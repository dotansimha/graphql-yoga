The goal is to provide a fully-featured, simple to set up, performant and extendable server. Some key features:

- [GraphQL-over-HTTP](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http) spec compliant
- Extend the GraphQL request flow using [`envelop`](https://www.envelop.dev/)
- File uploads (via GraphQL multipart request specification)
- GraphQL Subscriptions (using [SSE](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-sse))
- Logging using [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino)
- Improved TypeScript Support
- Try out experimental GraphQL features such as `@defer` and `@stream`
