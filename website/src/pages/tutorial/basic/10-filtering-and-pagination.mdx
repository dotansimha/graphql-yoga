# Filtering and Pagination

This is an exciting section of the tutorial where you'll implement some key features of many robust APIs! The goal is to
allow clients to constrain the list of `Link` elements returned by the `Query.feed` field by providing filtering and
pagination parameters.

Let's jump in! ðŸš€

## Filtering

By using `PrismaClient`, you'll be able to implement filtering capabilities to your API without too much effort.
Similar to the previous chapters, the heavy-lifting of query resolution will be performed by Prisma. All you need to
do is pass the correct parameters within the field resolver functions.

The first step is to think about the filters you want to expose through your API. In your case, the `Query.feed` field in your
API will accept a _filter string_. The query then should only return the `Link` elements where the `url` _or_ the
`description` _contain_ that filter string.

Go ahead and add the `filter` argument definition of the type `String` to the `Query.feed` field definition within your application schema (under `src/schema.ts`):

```graphql filename="src/schema.ts"
type Query {
  info: String!
  feed(filterNeedle: String): [Link!]!
  me: User!
}
```

Next, you need to update the implementation of the `Query.feed` resolver function to account for the new arguments clients can send when executing a GraphQL query operation.

Now, update the `Query.feed` resolver function to look as follows:

```ts
const resolvers = {
  // ... other resolver maps ...
  Query: {
    // ... other Query object type field resolver functions ...
    async feed(
      parent: unknown,
      args: { filterNeedle?: string },
      context: GraphQLContext
    ) {
      const where = args.filterNeedle
        ? {
            OR: [
              { description: { contains: args.filterNeedle } },
              { url: { contains: args.filterNeedle } }
            ]
          }
        : {}

      return context.prisma.link.findMany({ where })
    }
  }
}
```

If no `filterNeedle` argument value is provided, then the `where` object will be just an empty object and no filtering conditions will be applied by Prisma Client when it resolves the data for the `Query.links` field.

In cases where there is a `filterNeedle` argument provided when executing the `Query.links` field resolver, you're constructing a `where` object that expresses our two filter conditions from above. This `where` argument is used by Prisma to filter out those `Link` elements that
don't adhere to the specified conditions.

That's it for the filtering functionality! Go ahead and test your filter API - here's a sample query operation you can use:

```graphql
query {
  feed(filterNeedle: "QL") {
    id
    description
    url
    postedBy {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Pagination

Pagination is a tricky topic in API design. On a high level, there are two major approaches for tackling it:

- **Limit-Offset**: Request a specific _chunk_ of the list by providing the indices of the items to be retrieved. In
  fact, you're mostly providing the start index `offset` as well as a count of items to be retrieved `limit`.
- **Cursor-Based**: This pagination model is a bit more advanced. Every element in the list is associated with a unique
  ID (the _cursor_). Clients paginating through the list then provide the cursor of the starting element as well as a
  count of items to be retrieved.

Prisma supports both pagination approaches (read more in the
[docs](https://prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/pagination)). In this tutorial, you're going to implement limit-offset pagination.

  Note: You can read more about the ideas behind both pagination approaches
  [here](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/understanding-pagination-rest-graphql-and-relay-b10f835549e7).
</Callout>

Limit and offset have different names in the Prisma API:

- The _limit_ is called `take`, meaning you're "taking" `x` elements after a provided start index.
- The _start index_ is called `skip`, since you're skipping that many elements in the list before collecting the items to be returned. If `skip` is not provided, it's `0` by default. The pagination then always starts from the beginning of the list.

So, go ahead and add the `skip` and `take` arguments to the `Query.field` field definition.

Open your schema definitions and adjust the `Query.field` field to have a `skip` and `take` argument of the `Int` type defined:

```graphql
type Query {
  info: String!
  feed(filterNeedle: String, skip: Int, take: Int): [Link!]!
  me: User!
}
```

Now, adjust the field resolver function implementation:

And now adjust the implementation of the `Query.feed` resolver function:

```ts
const resolvers = {
  // ... other resolvers maps ...
  Query: {
    // ... other Query object type resolver functions ...
    async feed(
      parent: unknown,
      args: { filterNeedle?: string; skip?: number; take?: number },
      context: GraphQLContext
    ) {
      const where = args.filterNeedle
        ? {
            OR: [
              { description: { contains: args.filterNeedle } },
              { url: { contains: args.filterNeedle } }
            ]
          }
        : {}

      return context.prisma.link.findMany({
        where,
        skip: args.skip,
        take: args.take
      })
    }
  }
}
```

All that's changing here is that the invocation of the `links` query now receives two additional arguments which might be carried by the incoming `args` object. Again, Prisma will take care of the rest.

You can test the pagination API with the following query operation which returns the second `Link` from the list:

```graphql
query {
  feed(take: 1, skip: 1) {
    id
    description
    url
  }
}
```

## Pagination Field Argument Sanitization

In the last chapter, you already sanitized the arguments within the `Mutation.postCommentOnLink` field resolver function.

Up next, let's also take into consideration that the `Query.feed` arguments should also have some sanitizing.

As more links are posted onto the feed, the size of the feed increases. At some point, there could be thousands of feed items. When deploying the GraphQL API to production you would not want to allow querying ALL the links at once. That means you have to introduce a default value for the `take` argument.

Furthermore, you should limit the `take` argument to be within a range that makes sense for the feed. The original Hackernews shows 30 links per page.

Let's use the value 30 as the default value and 50 as the upper limit and 1 as the lower limit. Fetching 0 records does not make sense.

Adjust the current schema resolver implementation according to the following.

```ts
import { GraphQLYogaError } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
// ... other code ...

const applyTakeConstraints = (params: {
  min: number
  max: number
  value: number
}) => {
  if (params.value < params.min || params.value > params.max) {
    throw new GraphQLYogaError(
      `'take' argument value '${params.value}' is outside the valid range of '${params.min}' to '${params.max}'.`
    )
  }
  return params.value
}

const resolvers = {
  // ... other resolvers maps ...
  Query: {
    // ... other Query object type resolver functions ...
    async feed(
      parent: unknown,
      args: { filterNeedle?: string; skip?: number; take?: number },
      context: GraphQLContext
    ) {
      const where = args.filterNeedle
        ? {

              { url: { contains: args.filterNeedle } }
            ]
          }
        : {}

      const take = applyTakeConstraints({
        min: 1,
        max: 50,
        value: args.take ?? 30
      })

      return context.prisma.link.findMany({
        where,
        skip: args.skip,
        take
      })
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
// ... other code ...
import { GraphQLError } from 'graphql'

const applyTakeConstraints = (params: {
  min: number
  max: number
  value: number
}) => {
  if (params.value < params.min || params.value > params.max) {
    throw new GraphQLError(
      `'take' argument value '${params.value}' is outside the valid range of '${params.min}' to '${params.max}'.`
    )
  }
  return params.value
}

const resolvers = {
  // ... other resolvers maps ...
  Query: {
    // ... other Query object type resolver functions ...
    async feed(
      parent: unknown,
      args: { filterNeedle?: string; skip?: number; take?: number },
      context: GraphQLContext
    ) {
      const where = args.filterNeedle
        ? {
            OR: [
              { description: { contains: args.filterNeedle } },
              { url: { contains: args.filterNeedle } }
            ]
          }
        : {}

      const take = applyTakeConstraints({
        min: 1,
        max: 50,
        value: args.take ?? 30
      })

      return context.prisma.link.findMany({
        where,
        skip: args.skip,
        take
      })
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Cool! Now we can try executing an operation with a `take` argument value outside the range!

Execute the following query operation via GraphiQL:

```graphql
query {
  feed(take: -1) {
    id
    description
    url
  }
}
```

As expected, you receive an error:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "'take' argument value '-1' is outside the valid range of '1' to '50'.",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "path": ["feed"]
    }
  ],
  "data": null
}
```

## Optional Exercise

As an optional exercise for interiorizing the knowledge, you can now also implement validation of the `skip` argument of `Query.feed` field and prohibit using negative numbers.
