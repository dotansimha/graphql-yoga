# GraphQL Server

Now that you have a GraphQL schema, and you understand the concept of GraphQL schema and a GraphQL query, it's time to create a real GraphQL server.

You are going to use the HTTP protocol to serve the GraphQL server, but note that there are other options for serving GraphQL - you can use WebSocket, SSE (Server-Sent Events) and basically any network transport protocol that you wish! (You can find a list of transport implementations at the end of this page)

## Creating a GraphQL HTTP Server with Yoga

In this tutorial, we will be using GraphQL Yoga for building our Node.js GraphQL HTTP server.

<Callout>
  Yoga can also run on other platforms, such as Cloudflare Workers or Deno. We
  recommend checking out [the integrations
  section](/v3/integrations/integration-with-cloudflare-workers) in our
  documentation after finishing the tutorial.

You'll need the `@graphql-yoga/node` package available in your project, so install it using the following command:

<PackageCmd packages={['--save-exact @graphql-yoga/node']} />

Now, update `src/main.ts` to create a simple GraphQL HTTP server on port `4000`:

```ts filename="src/main.ts"
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
import { schema } from './schema'

async function main() {
  const server = createServer({ schema })
  await server.start()
}

main()
```

Now, try to run your server again with `npm run dev` (or, `npm run start`).

The output should look similar to the following:

```text
$ cross-env NODE_ENV=development ts-node-dev --exit-child --respawn src/main.ts
[INFO] 15:40:14 ts-node-dev ver. 1.1.8 (using ts-node ver. 9.1.1, typescript ver. 4.5.5)

You'll need the `graphql-yoga` package available in your project, so install it using
the following command:

<PackageCmd packages={['--save-exact graphql-yoga']} />

Now, update `src/main.ts` to create a simple GraphQL HTTP server on port `4000`:

```ts filename="src/main.ts"
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'http'
import { schema } from './schema'

function main() {
  const yoga = createYoga({ schema })
  const server = createServer(yoga)
  server.listen(4000, () => {
    console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
  })
}

main()
```

Now, try to run your server again with `npm run dev` (or, `npm run start`), open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.

Type in the following operation in the left editor section and press the `Play` button for executing the operation against the GraphQL server.

```graphql
query {
  hello
}
```

Unsurprisingly, the result looks like the following:

```json
{ "data": { "hello": "Hello World!" } }
```

Of course, it is also possible to send requests to the service without GraphiQL, e.g. by using `curl`.

Run the following command within your terminal for executing the same query operation.

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/graphql -H "Content-type: application/json" --data-raw '{"query": "query { hello }"}'
```

Oh wonder, the result looks like the following:

```json
{ "data": { "hello": "Hello World!" } }
```
