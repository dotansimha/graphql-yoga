# A Simple Mutation

In this section, you'll learn how to add a `Mutation` field to the GraphQL schema. This mutation field will allow you to _post_ new links
to the server.

## Extending the Schema Definition

Like before, you need to start by adding the new operation to your GraphQL schema definition.

In `src/schema.ts`, extend the schema definition as follows:

```ts filename="src/schema.ts"
const typeDefinitions = /* GraphQL */ `
  type Query {
    info: String!
    feed: [Link!]!
  }

  type Mutation {
    postLink(url: String!, description: String!): Link!
  }

  type Link {
    id: ID!
    description: String!
    url: String!
  }
`
```

## Implementing the Resolver Function

The next step in the process of adding a new feature to the API is to implement the resolver function for the new field.

Next, update the `resolvers` functions to look as follows:

```ts
type Link = {
  id: string
  url: string
  description: string
}

const links: Link[] = [
  {
    id: 'link-0',
    url: 'www.howtographql.com',
    description: 'Fullstack tutorial for GraphQL'
  }
]

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    info: () => `This is the API of a Hackernews Clone`,
    feed: () => links
  },
  Mutation: {
    postLink: (parent: unknown, args: { description: string; url: string }) => {
      // 1
      let idCount = links.length

      // 2
      const link: Link = {
        id: `link-${idCount}`,
        description: args.description,
        url: args.url
      }

      links.push(link)

      return link
    }
  }
}
```

First off, note that you're entirely removing the `Link` object type resolver map (as explained at the very end of the last section).
They are not needed because the GraphQL server infers what they look like.

Also, here's what's going on with the numbered comments:

1. You're adding a new integer variable that simply serves as a very rudimentary way to generate unique IDs for newly
   created `Link` elements
2. The implementation of the `postLink` resolver on the `Mutation` object type first creates a new `link` object, then adds it to the existing `links`
   array and finally returns the new `link`

Now's a good time to discuss the second argument that's passed into all resolver functions: `args`. Any guesses what it's used for?

Correct! ðŸ’¡ It carries the _arguments_ for the field that is sent â€“ in this case, the `url` and
`description` of the `Link` to be created. We didn't need it for the `feed` and `info`
resolvers before, because these `Query` object type fields don't specify any arguments
in the schema definition.

## Testing the Mutation

Go ahead and restart your server, so you can test the new API operations. Here is a sample mutation you can send through GraphiQL:

```graphql
mutation {
  postLink(
    url: "www.prisma.io"
    description: "Prisma replaces traditional ORMs"
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

The server response will look as follows:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "postLink": {
      "id": "link-1"
    }
  }
}
```

With every mutation you send, the `idCount` will increase and the following IDs for created links will be `link-2`,
`link-3`, and so forth...

To verify that your mutation worked, you can send the `feed` query operation from before again â€“ it now returns the additional.

The link that you created with the mutation:

However, once you kill and restart the server, you'll notice that the previously added links are now gone, and you need
to add them again. This is because the links are only stored _in-memory_, in the `links` array. In the next sections,
you will learn how to add a _database_ to the GraphQL server to persist the data beyond the runtime of the
server.
