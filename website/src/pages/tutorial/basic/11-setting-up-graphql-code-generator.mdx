# Setting up GraphQL Code Generator and Server Preset

In this section, you are going to set up
[GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) with Server Preset in your project.
This adds strong typing automatically, and reduces runtime error for your application.

## Preparation

First, let's install the required packages:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D --save-exact @graphql-codegen/cli@5.0.2 @eddeee888/gcg-typescript-resolver-files@0.10.4
```

- `@graphql-codegen/cli` is the main package for GraphQL Code Generator. It provides a CLI to
  generate code from your GraphQL schema.
- `@eddeee888/gcg-typescript-resolver-files` is a GraphQL Code Generator preset, written
  specifically for GraphQL servers. It automatically generates TypeScript types and resolver files.
  It also runs statical analysis to ensure type-safety.

So far, you've been keeping a lot of code together for simplicity. This new setup requires your
project to be structured in a way that it is still maintainable at scale. Most noticable, schema
type definitions and resolvers are separated into different files.

Let's start by creating a new folder `src/schema/base` and move the type definitions to a file
called `schema.graphql` under this folder:

```graphql filename="src/schema/base/schema.graphql"
type Query {
  info: String!
  feed(filterNeedle: String, skip: Int, take: Int): [Link!]!
  comment(id: ID!): Comment
}

type Mutation {
  postLink(url: String!, description: String!): Link!
  postCommentOnLink(linkId: ID!, body: String!): Comment!
}

type Link {
  id: ID!
  description: String!
  url: String!
  comments: [Comment!]!
}

type Comment {
  id: ID!
  body: String!
}
```

Next, create a `codegen.ts` at the root of your project:

```ts filename="codegen.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@eddeee888/gcg-typescript-resolver-files'
import type { CodegenConfig } from '@graphql-codegen/cli'

// (1)
const config: CodegenConfig = {
  schema: 'src/schema/**/schema.graphql', // (2)
  generates: {
    'src/schema': defineConfig({
      // (3)
      resolverGeneration: 'minimal', // (4)
      typesPluginsConfig: {
        contextType: '../context#GraphQLContext' // (5)
      }
    })
  }
}
export default config
```

This file contains the configuration for GraphQL Code Generator. Let's break it down:

1. The `config` variable tells GraphQL Code Generator what to generate.
2. The `schema` field points to the schema file you created.
3. The `generates` field tells GraphQL Code Generator where to put the generated files. In this
   case, Server Preset will generate files under `src/schema`
4. The `resolverGeneration: "minimal"` config tells Server Preset to generate just the root-level
   resolvers, unless there are mappers (more on this later).
5. The `contextType` config is used to generate the context type for every resolver.

Now, run the following command:

```sh
npx graphql-codegen
```

You will see a new folder `src/schema` created with the following files:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder defaultOpen name="src">
    <FileTree.Folder defaultOpen name="schema">
      <FileTree.Folder defaultOpen name="base">
        <FileTree.Folder defaultOpen name="resolvers">
          <FileTree.Folder defaultOpen name="Mutation">
            <FileTree.File name="postCommentOnLink.ts" />
            <FileTree.File name="postLink.ts" />
          </FileTree.Folder>
          <FileTree.Folder defaultOpen name="Query">
            <FileTree.File name="comment.ts" />
            <FileTree.File name="feed.ts" />
            <FileTree.File name="info.ts" />
          </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.File name="schema.graphql" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.File name="resolvers.generated.ts" />
      <FileTree.File name="resolvers.generated.graphqls" />
      <FileTree.File name="typeDefs.generated.ts" />
      <FileTree.File name="types.generated.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

1. `Mutation/postCommentOnLink.ts`, `Mutation/postLink.ts`, `Query/comment.ts`, `Query/feed.ts` and
   `Query/info.ts` are the generated root-level resolvers.
2. `resolvers.generated.ts` contains the resolvers map. All generated resolvers (e.g.
   `Query.comment`, `Mutation.postCommentOnLink`, etc.) are automatically imported into this file.
3. `schema.generated.graphqls` contains the merged schema of your application. In this example,
   there is only one `schema.graphql` file. However, as the server grows, you can choose to break it
   up into smaller modules, each with its own schema file e.g. `src/schema/comment/schema.graphql`,
   `src/schema/link/schema.graphql`, etc.
4. `typeDefs.generated.ts` contains the generated type definitions. This is the AST representation
   of the schema that can be provided to the GraphQL server.
5. `types.generated.ts` file contains the generated types.

Note that the generated root-level resolver files do not have any implementation yet, and there is
no object type resolvers. In the next section, you will learn how to migrate the existing
implementation.

## Migrate logic to new resolvers

### Root-level resolvers

By default, a generated root-level resolver file may look like this:

```ts filename="src/schema/base/resolvers/Query/feed.ts"
import type { QueryResolvers } from './../../../types.generated'

export const feed: NonNullable<QueryResolvers['feed']> = async (_parent, _arg, _ctx) => {
  /* Implement Query.feed resolver logic here */
}
```

It should be trivial to bring the existing logic over:

```ts filename="src/schema/base/resolvers/Query/feed.ts"
export const feed: NonNullable<QueryResolvers['feed']> = async (_parent, args, context) => {
  const where = args.filterNeedle
    ? {
        OR: [
          { description: { contains: args.filterNeedle } },
          { url: { contains: args.filterNeedle } }
        ]
      }
    : {}

  const take = applyTakeConstraints({
    min: 1,
    max: 50,
    value: args.take ?? 30
  })

  return context.prisma.link.findMany({
    where,
    skip: args.skip,
    take
  })
}
```

<Callout type='info'>
You don't have to manually type `parent`, `args` or `context` types. They are
automatically inferred by the `NonNullable<QueryResolvers['feed']>` type!
</Callout>

You may notice TypeScript may report an error that looks like this:

```ts twoslash
type Link = { id: number; createdAt: Date; description: string; url: string; comments: string[] }
type QueryResolvers = {
  feed: () => Promise<Link[]>
}
// ---cut---
// @error: Property 'comments' is missing in type '{ id: number; createdAt: Date; description: string; url: string; }' but required in type 'Link'.
export const feed: NonNullable<QueryResolvers['feed']> = async () => {
  // ---cut-start---
  return []
  // ---cut-end---
}
```

This is because the generated types forces you to return objects that match schema types to avoid
runtime errors. However, you want to defer resolve here by using mappers - like previous
implementation - to ensure `comments` is not fetched until it is requested. This is covered in the
next section.

### Using mappers

In the previous implementation, you used `Link` type from `@prisma/client` as the mapper for GraphQL
`Link` type. This is done by making `Query.feed` return an array of Prisma's `Link`, and manually
typed the `parent` of Link resolvers:

```ts filename="src/schema.ts (previously)"
// Previous implementation
import type { Link } from '@prisma/client'

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    // other resolvers
    feed: async (parent: unknown, args: {}, context: GraphQLContext): Promise<Link[]> => {
      // other logic
      return context.prisma.link.findMany() // Returns an array of Prisma's Link
    }
  },
  Link: {
    // Manually type the parent of each resolver as Prisma's Link
    id: (parent: Link) => parent.id,
    description: (parent: Link) => parent.description,
    url: (parent: Link) => parent.url,
    comments(parent: Link, args: {}, context: GraphQLContext) {
      return context.prisma.comment.findMany({
        where: {
          linkId: parent.id
        }
      })
    }
  }
}
```

The previous approach can be tedious as you need to manually wire up all the types. With the codegen
setup, you only need to declare Prisma's `Link` type as the mapper once, and it will be
automatically applied to all Link resolvers. Here are the steps of using mappers:

1. Create a new file to track mappers: `src/schema/base/schema.mappers.ts`. This file is in the same
   folder as the `schema.graphql` file.
2. Add mappers for types that exist in `schema.graphql` into `schema.mappers.ts` with the convention
   of `<GraphQL type name>Mapper`

For `Link`, it should look like this:

```ts filename="src/schema/base/schema.mappers.ts"
import type { Link } from '@prisma/client'

export type LinkMapper = Link
```

Now, when you run `npx graphql-codegen`, the following happens automatically:

- Typing `LinkMapper` as `parent` for every Link resolvers
- Creating `src/schema/base/resolvers/Link.ts`, and wire it up to the resolvers map in
  `resolvers.generated.ts`
- Running static analysis and suggests you to implement the `comments` resolvers to avoid runtime
  errors.

The generated `src/schema/base/resolvers/Link.ts` file may look like this:

```ts filename="src/schema/base/resolvers/Link.ts"
import type { LinkResolvers } from './../../types.generated'

/*
 * Note: This object type is generated because "LinkMapper" is declared. This is to ensure runtime safety.
 *
 * When a mapper is used, it is possible to hit runtime errors in some scenarios:
 * - given a field name, the schema type's field type does not match mapper's field type
 * - or a schema type's field does not exist in the mapper's fields
 *
 * If you want to skip this file generation, remove the mapper or update the pattern in the `resolverGeneration.object` config.
 */
export const Link: LinkResolvers = {
  /* Implement Link resolver logic here */
  comments: async (_parent, _arg, _ctx) => {
    /* Link.comments resolver is required because Link.comments exists but LinkMapper.comments does not */
  }
}
```

Note that `Link.id`, `Link.description` and `Link.url` resolvers are not generated. The types of
these properties in Prisma's Link are compatible to the mapper's types, meaning the resolvers can be
omitted.

Now, you can simply remove the comments, and migrate the existing `comments` resolver over:

```ts filename="src/schema/base/resolvers/Link.ts"
import type { LinkResolvers } from './../../types.generated'

export const Link: LinkResolvers = {
  comments: async (parent, _arg, context) => {
    return context.prisma.comment.findMany({
      where: {
        linkId: parent.id
      }
    })
  }
}
```

### Force create an object type resolver file

Sometimes, you may want to implement custom logic in your resolvers. Object type resolvers can be
generated by simply creating an empty file where the it should be generated, and run codegen.

For example, let's force create `Comment` object type resolver file. We know that `Comment` is a
type that is on the same level as `Link` in the resolvers map, so you can create an empty file
`src/schema/base/resolvers/Comment.ts`, then run `npx graphql-codegen`.

When codegen is run, Server Preset detects that you want to have custom logic for `Comment` type, so
it will fill in the content of the file, and wire it up to the resolvers map. The content may look
like this:

```ts filename="src/schema/base/resolvers/Comment.ts"
import type { CommentResolvers } from './../../types.generated'

export const Comment: CommentResolvers = {
  /* Implement Comment resolver logic here */
}
```

## Using generated resolvers map and type definitions

Once you have migrated all the resolver logic, the last step is to use the generated resolvers map
and type definitions to your server:

```ts filename="src/schema.ts"
import { createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { resolvers } from './schema/resolvers.generated'
import { typeDefs } from './schema/typeDefs.generated'

export const schema = createSchema({
  resolvers: [resolvers],
  typeDefs: [typeDefs]
})
```

### Maintaining generated files

The files with `.generated.` section are completely generated, and require no manual update or
intervention. Every time you run codegen, these files change based on your schema or mappers
changes. In other words, your schema and mappers are the source of truth, and the generated files
are the derived output.

For the reason above, it is recommended to _not_ commit these files to your version control, nor run
your development tools (such as linting and formatting) on them to avoid noise and unncessary work.
As long as you keep the generated files up-to-date with your schema and mappers, typecheck should
work correctly.

To ignore these generated files, add them to your tools' ignore file:

```sh
# .gitignore
*.generated.*

# .eslintignore
*.generated.*

# .prettierignore
*.generated.*
```

## Summary

In this section, you have set up GraphQL Code Generator with Server Preset in your project. This
setup takes care of all the types and resolvers convention for you, so you can focus on developing
your application!

## Optional Exercise

As an additional exercise, you can try migrating the rest of the resolvers and mappers to the new
setup.
