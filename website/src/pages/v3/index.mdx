GraphQL Yoga is a batteries-included cross-platform [GraphQL over HTTP](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http) spec-compliant GraphQL Server using [Envelop](https://envelop.dev), and [GraphQL Tools](https://graphql-tools.com) that runs anywhere.

## Installation

import { PackageCmd } from '@theguild/components'

<PackageCmd packages={['graphql graphql-yoga']} />

## Usage

You will need to provide schema to Yoga, either by an existing executable schema, or by providing your type definitions and resolver map.

```ts
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'http'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: {
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        hello: () => 'Hello from Yoga!',
      },
    },
  },
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000)
```

> Yoga uses GraphQL Tools under the hood so you'll want to follow the [`makeExecutableSchema`](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/generate-schema) pattern.

**That is it!**

Now visit [`http://localhost:4000/graphql`](http://localhost:4000/graphql) to execute the followiing query operation:

```graphql
query HelloWorld {
  hello
}
```

## Using existing schema

You can also pass an existing `GraphQLSchema` instance to `createServer`.

If you're using a library such as [Pothos](https://pothos-graphql.dev/), [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexusjs.org/), [gqtx](https://github.com/sikanhe/gqtx), or vanilla [`graphql-js`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema), you simply can pass the `GraphQLSchema` to `schema`:

```ts
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'http'

import { schema } from './schema'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema,
})

const server = createServer(yoga)

server.listen(4000)
```
