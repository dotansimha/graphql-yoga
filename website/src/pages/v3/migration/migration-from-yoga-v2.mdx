# Migration from Yoga V2

## Install the new NPM package

Now GraphQL Yoga has a single NPM package for all environments `graphql-yoga` instead of `@graphql-yoga/common` and `@graphql-yoga/node`.
So you need to uninstall `@graphql-yoga/common` and `@graphql-yoga/node` then install `graphql-yoga` from NPM.

<PackageCmd packages={['graphql-yoga@three']} />

## `createServer` renamed to `createYoga`

In order to prevent the confusion, we decided to rename `createServer` function to `createYoga`.

```diff
- import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
+ import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { schema } from './schema';

- const yoga = createServer({
+ const yoga = createYoga({
     schema,
 })
```

## `handleIncomingMessage` renamed to `handleNodeRequest`

For some frameworks, we need to use this low-level function such as Fastify and Koa. So you can basically rename the method to `handleNodeRequest`.

## No more `.start` and `.stop`

Previously on Node and CF/Service Workers environments, Yoga handles server processes with `.start` and `.stop` methods together with some environment specific server configurations. Yoga no longer deals with HTTP server configuration so the following changes needed;

### For Node

```diff
- import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
+ import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
+ import { createServer } from 'http'

- const server = createServer({
-     port: 4000,
-     hostname: '127.0.0.1'
- })
+ const yoga = createYoga({})
+ const server = createServer(yoga)

- server.start()
+ server.listen(4000, '127.0.0.1')
```

### For CF/Service Workers

```diff
- yoga.start()
+ self.addEventListener('fetch', yoga)
```

## No more Node specific multipart configuration

Previously it was possible to configure limitations of multipart request processing in `@graphql-yoga/node` package but now `graphql-yoga` package is completely platform agnostic and we avoid to have any Node specific configuration in GraphQL Yoga. But it is still possible to keep the same behavior by configuring `@whatwg-node/fetch` which is used by GraphQL Yoga internally for Node.js.

```diff
- import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
+ import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
+ import { createFetch } from '@whatwg-node/fetch'

- const yoga = createServer({
+ const yoga = createYoga({
+  fetchAPI: createFetch({
+     // We prefer `node-fetch` over `undici` and current unstable Node's implementation
+     useNodeFetch: true,
+     formDataLimits: {
-  multipart: {
      // Maximum allowed file size (in bytes)
      fileSize: 1000000,
      // Maximum allowed number of files
      files: 10,
      // Maximum allowed size of content (operations, variables etc...)
      fieldSize: 1000000,
      // Maximum allowed header size for form data
      headerSize: 1000000,
    },
+  }),
})
```

## Removed `endpoint` and `graphiql.endpoint` options

In v2, there is `endpoint` option which is used to configure the GraphQL endpoint, and `graphiql.endpoint` to point `GraphiQL` to a different GraphQL API.
Now they are removed in favor `graphqlEndpoint` option. If you want to use `YogaGraphiQL` for a different GraphQL endpoint, you can use `@graphql-yoga/render-graphiql` package separately.

```diff
- import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
+ import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
- createServer({
+ createYoga({
-  endpoint: '/graphql',
-  graphiql: {
-    endpoint: '/graphiql',
-  },
+  graphqlEndpoint: '/graphql',
})
```

## No more `GraphQLYogaError`, use `GraphQLError` instead

In v2, we introduced a new error class `GraphQLYogaError` which is a subclass of `GraphQLError` and it is now deprecated in favor of `GraphQLError`.
So in resolvers, you can use it in the same way but the second parameter of `GraphQLError` constructor is not `extensions` but an object that contains more options for `GraphQLError`.
You can basically do the following change;

```diff
- import { GraphQLYogaError } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
+ import { GraphQLError } from 'graphql'

- const myError = new GraphQLYogaError('My error message', {
+ const myError = new GraphQLError('My error message', {
+  extensions: {
    code: 'MY_CODE',
    myCustomField: 'myCustomValue',
+  },
})
```

Also you can change the status code and headers of the error response by using the `extensions` object.

```ts
new GraphQLError('My error message', {
  extensions: {
    code: 'NOT_LOGGED_IN',
    message: 'You need to be logged in to do this',
    http: {
      status: 401,
      headers: {
        'X-Custom-Header': 'my-custom-value'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## No more `readinessCheckEndpoint`, consider using the `useReadinessCheck` plugin instead

A readiness health check is not something Yoga can accurately perform as it requires user-land context. Read more about the [new health check](/v3/features/health-check).

```diff
- import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
+ import { createYoga, useReadinessCheck } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { schema, checkDbAvailable } from './my-service';

- const yoga = createServer({
+ const yoga = createYoga({
     schema,
-    readinessCheckEndpoint: '/ready',
+    useReadinessCheck({
+      endpoint: '/ready' // default,
+      check: async () => {
+        // if resolves, respond with 200 OK
+        // if throw, respond with 504 Service Unavailable and error message as plaintext in body
+        await checkDbAvailable()
+      },
+    })
 })
```
