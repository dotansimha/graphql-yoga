import { PackageCmd } from '@theguild/components'

## Installation

You can start with installing `graphql-yoga` package.import { PackageCmd } from '@theguild/components';

<PackageCmd packages={['graphql-yoga']} />

### Install equivalent **Envelop** plugins of the Apollo Server

Some features that are included within apollo-server by default must be installed as envelop plugins ([Learn more about envelop plugins here](/docs/features/envelop-plugins)).

- Apollo Federation
  - If you are using Apollo Federation, [install `@envelop/use-apollo-federation`](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins/use-apollo-federation)
- Apollo Server Errors
  - If you are using Apollo Server errors, [install `@envelop/use-apollo-server-errors`](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins/use-apollo-server-errors)
- Apollo Tracing
  - If you are using Apollo Tracing, [install `@envelop/use-apollo-tracing`](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins/use-apollo-tracing)
- Response Cache
  - If you are using Response Cache, [you should set up `@envelop/use-response-cache`](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins/use-response-cache) for the same functionality

[Check out more plugins on Envelop Plugin Hub](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins)

## Example initial usage of GraphQL Yoga

For example if you are using Apollo Server Errors;

`apollo-server-errors-example.ts`

```diff
import { schema } from './schema'
- import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server'
+ import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
+ import { useApolloServerErrors } from '@envelop/apollo-server-errors'

- const server = new ApolloServer({
+ const yoga = createYoga({
  // You can also pass `typeDefs` and `resolvers` here directly if you previously use `ApolloServer` constructor to build your `GraphQLSchema`
  // schema: { typeDefs, resolvers },
  schema,
+  plugins: [useApolloServerErrors()],
})

+ const server = createServer(yoga)

server.listen(4000)
+ server.listen(4000)
```

## Migration from standalone `apollo-server`

You don't need anything special. You can just use GraphQL Yoga as in the example above.

## Migration from `apollo-server-*`

Check the integration section to choose the server framework you are using with Apollo Server.

For example, if you are using **Express**, you should remove the standalone HTTP server part(`createServer(yoga)` & `server.listen(4000)`) from the code above and replace `server.applyMiddleware({ app })` with the route as in [Express Integration section](/docs/integrations/integration-with-express)

```diff
- server.applyMiddleware({ app })
+ app.use('/graphql', yoga)
```

## Batched Queries/Requests

Batched queries is a practice first supported and made popular by the Apollo ecosystem.
The idea of batched query operations is to reduce the number of network requests by grouping them together.
This is achieved by slightly delaying the HTTP request in order to gather all the query operations that are executed shortly after each other.

GraphQL Yoga does not support batched queries for the following reasons:

**_All batched queries are as slow as the longest running individual query._**

Because the GraphQL server does not start sending a response to the client until all the queries are completed, a slow query will prevent a faster query result to be already processed/shown to the end user.

**_Batched queries can ba achieved by componsing multiple GraphQL fragments/operation into a single one._**

Instead of having two operations:

```graphql
query A {
  viewer {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

```graphql
query B($postId: ID!) {
  post(id: $postId) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

These operations can be combined into a single operation:

```graphql
query AB($postId: ID!) {
  viewer {
    id
    name
  }
  post(id: $postId) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

Furthermore, if you want a partial of the GraphQL operation to arrive at the client as soon as possible, you can use the `@defer` directive.

```graphql
query AB($postId: ID!) {
  ... on Query @defer(label: "A") {
    viewer {
      id
      name
    }
  }
  ... on Query @defer(label: "A") {
    post(id: $postId) {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```
