AWS Lambda is a serverless computing platform that makes it easy to build applications that run on the AWS cloud. GraphQL Yoga is platform agnostic so they can fit together easily.
In order to reduce the boilerplate we prefer to use [Serverless Express from Vendia](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express).

## Installation

import { PackageCmd } from '@theguild/components'

<PackageCmd
  packages={['graphql', '@vendia/serverless-express', 'graphql-yoga']}
/>

## Example

`graphql.ts`

```ts
import type { Handler } from '@aws-cdk/aws-lambda'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { configure } from '@vendia/serverless-express'

const app = createYoga()

export const handler: Handler = configure({
  // Pass Yoga as app
  app,
  // Pass Yoga's logger to listen to the logs from Serverless Express as well
  log: app.logger,
})
```
