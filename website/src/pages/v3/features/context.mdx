# GraphQL Context

A context is usually created for each execution of a GraphQL Operation, and it is passed to the resolver functions as a third argument.
You can learn more about [`Context` in GraphQL Tools docs](https://graphql-tools.com/docs/connectors).

It is commonly used for doing dependency injection.

Within GraphQL Yoga, the context object is generated per HTTP request.

## Default Context

By default, GraphQL Yoga provides the following values in the context object independently of your environment and setup:

- `request` - [Fetch API `Request` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) that represents the incoming HTTP request in platform-independent way. It can be useful for accessing headers to authenticate a user
- `query` - the `DocumentNode` that was parsed from the GraphQL query string
- `operationName` - the operation name selected from the incoming query
- `variables` - the variables that were defined in the query
- `extensions` - the extensions that were received from the client

### Context Usage Example: Log Headers

```ts
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'http'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        logHeader: Boolean
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        logHeader(_, _args, context) {
          console.log(context.request.headers.get('x-foo'))
        },
      },
    },
  }),
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-foo: iliketurtles"
  --data-raw '{"query": "query { logHeader }"}'
```

## Extending the Initial Context

You can extend the existing context by using the `context` property.

### Example: Object

```ts
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'http'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        someNumber: Int!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        someNumber(_, _args, context) {
          context.someNumber
        },
      },
    },
  }),
  context: { someNumber: 13 },
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

You can also pass a function as the `context` property. The function will be invoked for each incoming GraphQL request with the initial context as an argument and after the invocation it will be merged with the initial context.

### Example: Function Returning an Object

```ts
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'http'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        someNumber: Int!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        someNumber(_, _args, context) {
          context.someNumber
        },
      },
    }),
  },
  context() {
    return { someNumber: 13 }
  },
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
    console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

The function can either return an object or a Promise that resolves to an object.

### Example: Function Returning a Promise

```ts
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'http'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        someNumber: Int!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        someNumber: (_, _args, context) => context.someNumber,
      },
    },
  }),
  async context() {
    return { someNumber: 13 }
  },
})
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

## Advanced Context Life-Cycle

For most users, the previous sections are already sufficient.
If you, however, need to integrate Yoga with a custom framework and/or want to attach runtime/framework-specific Request/Response objects to the context.
Also, if you are just curious about how Yoga works in depth, this might also be interesting to you!

There are 4 steps that GraphQL Yoga follows to generate the final context object:

- [Default Context](#default-context) - this context is constructed for each incoming request and the same on all platforms
- [Server Context](#server-context) - the content of this context extension depends on the platform (Node.js/Deno/etc.) and the framework (raw Node.js/express/fastify)
- [User Context](#user-context) - this context is created for each incoming request with access to the default and server context
- [Envelop Plugin Context](#envelop-plugins) - the context from envelop plugins is processed last, the plugins have access to the default context, server context and user context

### Default Context

See the above section [default context](#default-context).

### Server Context

When creating the server instance, GraphQL Yoga accepts an additional object from your base server framework or library that will be merged with the default context.

#### Node.js (standalone, express and Next.js etc.)

If you are using GraphQL Yoga as a standalone server with `.start()` method or exposing it as a middleware as we show in our [express](/docs/integrations/integration-with-express) and [Next.js](/docs/integrations/integration-with-nextjs) recipes.

- `req` - Node.js [`IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object
- `res` - Node.js [`ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) object

The `req` and `res` objects are added to the initial context object.

```ts
const serverContext = { ...defaultContext, req, res }
```

Thus when using `@graphql-yoga/node`, it is possible to access `context.req` and `context.res` within the GraphQL resolvers or the user context factory function.

However, we recommend avoiding using `context.req` and `context.res` wherever possible and instead favor `context.request`, as it is more future-proof (as Node.js HTTP servers adopt the Fetch Response API).

#### Advanced Node.js frameworks (Fastify/Koa)

You might notice that the middleware implementation is more complex for server frameworks like [Fastify](/docs/integrations/integration-with-fastify) and [koa](/docs/integrations/integration-with-koa), because of their custom request handling behavior.
It is not possible to use a basic Node.js [RequestListener](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) function.

Since they limit the access to the underlying raw `ServerResponse` object, the recipes use the `.handleIncomingMessage` method and pass the server context as the second parameter.

E.g. for **_Fastify_**, a [`Reply`](https://fastify.io/docs/latest/Reply) object is attached to the server context instead of the `Request` object, which is an intermediate framework-specific response format.
Also, note the generic definition in `createServer` for correctly typing the server context.

```ts
const yoga = createYoga<{
  req: FastifyRequest
  reply: FastifyReply
}>()

// somewhere within the request handler

const response = await yoga.handleNodeRequest(req, {
  req,
  reply,
})
```

#### Fetch API Request compliant environments (Cloudflare Workers/Deno)

If you are using [Cloudflare Workers according to the integration guide](/docs/integrations/integration-with-cloudflare-workers), the [WHATWG `FetchEvent` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent) will be added as the server context object.
That object is almost identical to what GraphQL Yoga provides you within `YogaInitialContext`.

### User Context

Besides, the initial context generated based on your setup, GraphQL Yoga also accepts a user context object that will be merged with the initial context (built out of the default context and server context).
You can pass a factory function to `context` parameter of `createServer` configuration.
That function will receive the combination of the standard initial context and the server's (if available), then the return value will be merged into that.

```ts
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

const yoga = createYoga({
  context: async ({ request }) => {
    // get custom header value
    const foo = request.headers.get('x-foo') ?? null
    return { foo }
server.listen(4000, () => {
    console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
    console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

In this case, your final context object will have an extra `foo` property.

See the above section [extending the initial context](#extending-the-initial-context) for more details and usage examples.

## Envelop Plugins

After all of the above, Envelop plugins (if you have some) receive the context object and can modify or extend it.
See the documentation for [Envelop plugins](/docs/features/envelop-plugins) for more information.
