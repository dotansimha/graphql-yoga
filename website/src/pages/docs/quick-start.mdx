# Quick Start

GraphQL Yoga is a batteries-included cross-platform [GraphQL over HTTP](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http) spec-compliant GraphQL Server using [Envelop](https://envelop.dev), and [GraphQL Tools](https://graphql-tools.com) that runs anywhere.

## Installation

<PackageCmd packages={['graphql', '@graphql-yoga/node']} />

## Usage

You will need to provide a schema to Yoga, either by an existing executable schema or by providing your type definitions and resolver map.

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

const server = createServer({
  schema: {
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        hello: () => 'Hello from Yoga!',
      },
    },
  },
})

server.start()
```

<Callout type="info">
  Yoga uses GraphQL Tools under the hood so you'll want to follow the
  [`makeExecutableSchema`](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/generate-schema)
  pattern.
</Callout>

**That is it!**

Now visit [`http://localhost:4000/graphql`](http://localhost:4000/graphql) to execute the following query operation:

```graphql
query HelloWorld {
  hello
}
```

## Using Existing Schema

You can also pass an existing `GraphQLSchema` instance to `createServer`.

If you're using a library such as [Pothos](https://pothos-graphql.dev/), [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexusjs.org/), [gqtx](https://github.com/sikanhe/gqtx), or vanilla [`graphql-js`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema), you simply can pass the `GraphQLSchema` to `schema`:

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

import { schema } from './schema'

const server = createServer({
  schema,
})

server.start()
```
