# Migration from Apollo Server

## Installation

You can start by installing `graphql-yoga` package.

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-yoga/node']} />

### Install Equivalent **Envelop** Plugins of The Apollo Server

Some features that are included within apollo-server by default must be installed as envelop plugins ([Learn more about envelop plugins here](/docs/features/envelop-plugins)).

- Apollo Federation
  - If you are using Apollo Federation, [install `@envelop/use-apollo-federation`](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins/use-apollo-federation)
- Apollo Server Errors
  - If you are using Apollo Server errors, [install `@envelop/use-apollo-server-errors`](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins/use-apollo-server-errors)
- Apollo Tracing
  - If you are using Apollo Tracing, [install `@envelop/use-apollo-tracing`](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins/use-apollo-tracing)
- Response Cache
  - If you are using Response Cache, [you should set up `@envelop/use-response-cache`](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins/use-response-cache) for the same functionality

[Check out more plugins on Envelop Plugin Hub](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins)

## Example Initial Usage of GraphQL Yoga

For example, if you are using Apollo Server Errors;

`apollo-server-errors-example.ts`

```diff
import { schema } from './schema'
- import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server'
+ import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
+ import { useApolloServerErrors } from '@envelop/apollo-server-errors'

- const server = new ApolloServer({
+ const server = createServer({
  // You can also pass `typeDefs` and `resolvers` here directly if you previously use `ApolloServer` constructor to build your `GraphQLSchema`
  // schema: { typeDefs, resolvers },
  schema,
+  plugins: [useApolloServerErrors()],
})

server.start()
```

## Migration From Standalone `apollo-server`

You don't need anything special. You can just use GraphQL Yoga as in the example above.

## Migration From `apollo-server-*`

Check the integration section to choose the server framework you are using with Apollo Server.

For example, if you are using **Express**, you should remove `server.start()` from the code above and replace `server.applyMiddleware({ app })` with the route as in [Express Integration section](/docs/integrations/integration-with-express)

```diff
- server.applyMiddleware({ app })
+ app.use('/graphql', server)
```
