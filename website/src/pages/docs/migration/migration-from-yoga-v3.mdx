# Migration from Yoga V3

## Install the new NPM package

<PackageCmd packages={['graphql-yoga']} />

## Drop unused graphiql options `defaultVariableEditorOpen` and `headerEditorEnabled`

These two graphiql options were not used and are now removed completely.

```diff
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { schema } from './schema'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema,
  graphiql: {
-    defaultVariableEditorOpen: false,
-    headerEditorEnabled: false
  }
})
```

## Subscriptions use GraphQL over SSE "distinct connections mode"

Yoga previously used a custom, and simple, subscriptions transport over SSE. Now it implements the [GraphQL over SSE "distinct connections mode"](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-sse/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#distinct-connections-mode) instead.

Nothing has changed on the server; but, on the client-side, we recommend you use [`graphql-sse`](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/sse). The [recipes section](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/sse/recipes) will help you get going with any client out there!
