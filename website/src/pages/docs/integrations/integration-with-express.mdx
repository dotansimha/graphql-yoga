# Integration with Express

[Express is the most popular web framework for Node.js.](https://expressjs.com/) It is a minimalist framework that provides a robust set of features to handle HTTP on Node.js applications.
You can easily integrate GraphQL Yoga into your Express application with a few lines of code.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i express graphql-yoga graphql
```

## Example

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

const app = express()

const yoga = createYoga()

// Bind GraphQL Yoga to the graphql endpoint to avoid rendering the playground on any path
app.use(yoga.graphqlEndpoint, yoga)

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

## Using Helmet

If you are using [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) to set your [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), you can use the following configuration:

```ts
app.use(
  helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      directives: {
        'style-src': ["'self'", 'unpkg.com'],
        'script-src': ["'self'", 'unpkg.com', "'unsafe-inline'"],
        'img-src': ["'self'", 'raw.githubusercontent.com']
      }
    }
  })
)
```

[See GraphiQL documentation page for more informations](../features/graphiql#usage-with-content-security-policy)

### Isolate GraphiQL configuration

To avoid applying this configuration to other endpoints you may have on your Express server,
you can use `Express.Router` to create a new router instance and apply the configuration only to the GraphQL Yoga endpoint.

```ts
import express from 'express'
import helmet from 'helmet'

const app = express()

const yoga = createYoga()
const yogaRouter = express.Router()
// GraphiQL specefic CSP configuration
yogaRouter.use(
  helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      directives: {
        'style-src': ["'self'", 'unpkg.com'],
        'script-src': ["'self'", 'unpkg.com', "'unsafe-inline'"],
        'img-src': ["'self'", 'raw.githubusercontent.com']
      }
    }
  })
)
yogaRouter.use(yoga)

// By adding the GraphQL Yoga router before the global helmet middleware,
// you can be sure that the global CSP configuration will not be applied to the GraphQL Yoga endpoint
app.use(yoga.graphqlEndpoint, yogaRouter)

// Add the global CSP configuration for the rest of your server.
app.use(helmet())

// You can know register your other endpoints that will not be affected by the GraphiQL CSP configuration
app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```
