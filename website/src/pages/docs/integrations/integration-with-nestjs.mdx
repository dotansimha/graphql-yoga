# Integration with NestJS

[Nest (Nest JS)](https://nestjs.com) is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.

GraphQL Yoga provides its own Nest GraphQL Driver that support building standalone GraphQL APIs and Apollo Federation GraphQL APIs (Gateway and Services).

<Callout>
  For the setup of a new Nest project, please make sure to read the [Nest
  GraphQL documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start).
</Callout>

## Standalone

### Install

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @nestjs/graphql @graphql-yoga/nestjs graphql-yoga graphql
```

### Create Application Module

```typescript
import { YogaDriver, YogaDriverConfig } from '@graphql-yoga/nestjs'
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql'

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLModule.forRoot<YogaDriverConfig>({
      driver: YogaDriver
    })
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Develop GraphQL

This is just a HTTP transport driver; meaning, everything else should work as [showcased in NestJS documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/resolvers).

## Apollo Federation

Separately, we offer a `@graphql-yoga/nestjs-federation` driver which allows building Apollo Federation Gateways and Services through the `YogaGatewayDriver` and `YogaFederationDriver` drivers.

### Install

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @nestjs/graphql @graphql-yoga/nestjs-federation graphql-yoga graphql
```

### Create Application Module

```typescript
import {
  YogaFederationDriver,
  YogaFederationDriverConfig
} from '@graphql-yoga/nestjs-federation'
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql'

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLModule.forRoot<YogaFederationDriverConfig>({
      driver: YogaFederationDriver,
      typePaths: ['**/*.graphql']
    })
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Develop GraphQL

This is just a federation and gateway driver; meaning, everything else should work as [showcased in NestJS federation documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/federation).

<Callout>
  A complete example, with full Apollo Federation Subgraph Compatibility, [is
  available in the
  repository](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga/tree/main/examples/nestjs-apollo-federation-compatibility).
