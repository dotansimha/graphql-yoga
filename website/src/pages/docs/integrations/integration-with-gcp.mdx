# Integration with Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services powered by Google.
It is easy to use GraphQL Yoga with GCP.

## Installation

<PackageCmd packages={['graphql', 'graphql-yoga']} />

## Usage

```js
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

export const graphql = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () =>
          'This is the `greetings` field of the root `Query` type'
      }
    }
  }),
  graphqlEndpoint: '*'
})
```

<Callout>
  This example uses ESM syntax, so you set `"type": "module"` in your
  `package.json`.
