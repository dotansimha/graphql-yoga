# Integration with Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services powered by Google.
It is easy to use GraphQL Yoga with GCP.

## Installation

<PackageCmd packages={['graphql', 'graphql-yoga']} />

## Usage

```js
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

// This is the endpoint of your GCP function
// Usually it is https://<region>-<project-id>.cloudfunctions.net/<function-name>
// We assume that your function name is `graphql`
const graphqlEndpoint = '/graphql'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () =>
          'This is the `greetings` field of the root `Query` type'
      }
    }
  }),
  graphqlEndpoint
})

// The exported variable name should be the same with `Entry point` value defined in Cloud Functions configuration
export function graphql(req, res) {
  // GCP doesn't expose the full path so we need to patch it
  req.url = graphqlEndpoint + req.url
  return yoga(req, res)
}
```

<Callout>
  This example uses ESM syntax, so you set `"type": "module"` in your
  `package.json`.
