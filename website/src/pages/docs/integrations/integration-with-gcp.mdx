# Integration with Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services powered by Google. It is easy to use GraphQL Yoga with GCP.

## Prerequisites

You will first need to install the GCP command-line tool: `gcloud`. [You can find instructions here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

If you already have `gcloud` installed, make sure it is up to date with `gcloud components update`.

[Create a new project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) and make sure [billing is enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled).

<Callout type="warning">
  Running these examples requires you to have billing enabled on your GCP
  account. It should not cost more than a few cents, but don't forget to clean
  up your project after you are done to avoid unexpected charges.
</Callout>

## Cloud Functions

Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. With Cloud Functions, you write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events, such as an HTTP request.

It is probably the most straight forward way to deploy a Yoga server to GCP.

### Installation

<PackageCmd
  packages={['graphql', 'graphql-yoga', '@google-cloud/functions-framework']}
/>

<Callout type="info">
  Don't forget to add the `main` field to your `package.json`. Google Cloud
  Functions rely on it to know which file to run.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  This example uses ESM syntax, so you should set `"type": "module"` in your
  `package.json`.
</Callout>

### Usage

```js filename=index.js
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

export const graphql = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () =>
          'This is the `greetings` field of the root `Query` type'
      }
    }
  }),
  graphqlEndpoint: '*'
})
```

You can now deploy your function with `gcloud` CLI:

```bash
$ gcloud functions deploy graphql --runtime nodejs18 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated
```

You can now test your function by using the URL found in the `httpsTrigger.url` property returned by the previous command or by using the `gcloud` CLI:

```bash
gcloud functions describe graphql
```

## Cloud Run

Cloud Run is the Platform as a Service by Google. It is straightforward to use Yoga with it.

### Installation

Create a new Node project and add Yoga to its dependencies.

<PackageCmd packages={['graphql', 'graphql-yoga']} />

<Callout type="info">
  This example uses ESM syntax, so you should set `"type": "module"` in your
  `package.json`.
</Callout>

Add a `start` script to your `package.json`. Cloud Run needs to know how to start your application.

```json
{
  "name": "graphql-yoga-cloud-run-guide",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ."
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "graphql": "^16.6.0",
    "graphql-yoga": "^3.9.1"
  }
}
```

### Usage

Create a GraphQL server with your schema. You can use any HTTP server; here we will use Node's HTTP implementation.

```js
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'node:http'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () =>
          'This is the `greetings` field of the root `Query` type'
      }
    }
  })
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT) || 4000

server.listen(port, () => {
  console.info(
    `Server is running on http://localhost:${port}${yoga.graphqlEndpoint}`
  )
})
```

You can now deploy to Cloud Run. You can use all default values, except the last one, which allows unauthenticated access to your service.

```bash
$ gcloud run deploy --source .
```

<Callout type="info">
  If this is your first time using Cloud Run, enabling the service can take up
  to a few minutes to be fully effective. If you encounter any `403 Forbidden`
  errors, please wait for 2 minutes and try again.
</Callout>

You can now access your API using the URL provided by `gcloud`. The default GraphQL endpoint is `/graphql`.

If you need to use TypeScript or any other tool that requires a build phase, such as code generation, add a Dockerfile to the root of your project so that Cloud Run can build a custom image for you.
