# Integration with AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing platform that makes it easy to build applications that run on the AWS cloud. GraphQL Yoga is platform-agnostic so they can fit together easily.
To reduce the boilerplate we prefer to use [Serverless Express from Vendia](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express).

## Installation

<PackageCmd
  packages={['@vendia/serverless-express @graphql-yoga/node graphql']}
/>

## Example

```ts filename="graphql.ts"
import type { Handler } from '@aws-cdk/aws-lambda'
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
import { configure } from '@vendia/serverless-express'

const app = createServer()

export const handler: Handler = configure({
  // Pass Yoga as app
  app,
  // Pass Yoga's logger to listen to the logs from Serverless Express as well
  log: app.logger,
})
```
