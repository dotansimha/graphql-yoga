# GraphQL Context

A context is usually created for each execution of a GraphQL Operation, and it is injected into the
GraphQL field resolver functions. It is commonly used for doing dependency injection, e.g. if you
want to access the current user or other information.

Within GraphQL Yoga, the context object is constructed for each incoming HTTP request.

## Default Context

By default, GraphQL Yoga provides the following values in the context object independently of your
environment and setup:

- `request` - [Fetch API `Request` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)
  that represents the incoming HTTP request in platform-independent way. It can be useful for
  accessing headers for authenticating a client
- `params` - Parameters of GraphQL Request
  - `query` - the `DocumentNode` that was parsed from the GraphQL query string sent by a client
  - `operationName` - the operation name selected from the incoming query sent by a client
  - `variables` - the variables that were defined in the query sent by a client
  - `extensions` - the extensions that were received from the client sent by a client

### Context Usage Example: Log Headers

```ts filename="Context Usage Log Headers" {14}
import { createServer } from 'http'
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        logHeader: Boolean
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        logHeader(_, _args, context) {
          console.log(context.request.headers.get('x-foo'))
        }
      }
    }
  })
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

```sh filename="Execute operation and see logs in terminal"
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-foo: iliketurtles"
--data-raw '{"query": "query { logHeader }"}'
```

## Extending the Initial Context

You can extend the existing context by providing a `context` property to the `createYoga` call.

### Example: Object

```ts filename="Extending Context" {19}
import { createServer } from 'http'
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        someNumber: Int!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        someNumber(_, _args, context) {
          context.someNumber
        }
      }
    }
  }),
  context: { someNumber: 13 }
})

const server = createServer(yoga)

server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

Instead, you can also pass a function as the `context` property. The function will be invoked for
each incoming GraphQL request with the initial context as an argument. The context returned from
that function will be merged with the initial context.

### Example: Function Returning an Object

```ts filename="Returning function for context" {20}
import { createServer } from 'http'
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        someNumber: Int!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        someNumber(_, _args, context) {
          return context.someNumber
        }
      }
    }
  }),
  context() {
    return { someNumber: 13 }
  }
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

The function can either return an object or a Promise that resolves to an object.

### Example: Function Returning a Promise

```ts filename="Returning promise for context creation" {17-19}
import { createServer } from 'http'
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        someNumber: Int!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        someNumber: (_, _args, context) => context.someNumber
      }
    }
  }),
  async context() {
    return { someNumber: 13 }
  }
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

## Advanced Context Life-Cycle

For most users, the previous sections are already sufficient.

If you, however, need to integrate Yoga with a custom framework and/or want to attach
runtime/framework-specific Request/Response objects to the context, or, if you are just curious
about how Yoga works in depth, this might also be interesting information for you!

There are in total four steps that GraphQL Yoga follows to generate the final context object.

- [Default Context](#default-context) - created for each incoming request and the same on all
  platforms
- [Server Context](#server-context) - depends on the platform (Node.js/Deno/etc.) and the framework
  (raw Node.js/express/fastify)
- [User Context](#user-context) - created for each incoming request with access to the default and
  server context
- [Envelop Plugin Context](#envelop-plugins) - created last, the plugins have access to the default
  context, server context and user context

### Default Context

See the above section [default context](#default-context).

### Server Context

When creating the server instance, GraphQL Yoga accepts an additional object from your base server
framework or library that will be merged with the default context.

#### Node.js (standalone, express and Next.js etc.)

If you are using GraphQL Yoga as a standalone server with `createServer` from the `http(s)` module
or exposing it as a middleware as we show in the
[express](/docs/integrations/integration-with-express) or
[Next.js](/docs/integrations/integration-with-nextjs) integration recipes.

- `req` - Node.js
  [`IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object
- `res` - Node.js
  [`ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) object

The `req` and `res` objects are added to the initial context object.

```ts
const serverContext = { ...defaultContext, req, res }
```

Thus, when using `@graphql-yoga/node`, it is possible to access `context.req` and `context.res`
within the GraphQL resolvers or the user context factory function.

However, we recommend avoiding using `context.req` and `context.res` wherever possible and instead
favor `context.request`, as it is more future-proof and platform independent (as Node.js HTTP
servers adopt the Fetch Response API).

#### Advanced Node.js frameworks (Fastify/Koa)

You might notice that the middleware implementation is more complex for server frameworks like
[Fastify](/docs/integrations/integration-with-fastify) and
[koa](/docs/integrations/integration-with-koa), because of their custom non standard request
handling behavior. It is not possible to use a basic Node.js
[RequestListener](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) function.

Since they limit the access to the underlying raw `ServerResponse` object, the recipes use the
`.handleIncomingMessage` method and pass the server context as the second parameter.

E.g. for **_Fastify_**, a [`Reply`](https://fastify.io/docs/latest/Reply) object is attached to the
server context instead of the `Request` object, which is an intermediate framework-specific response
format. Also, note the generic definition in `createYoga` for correctly typing the server context.

```ts filename="Typing request for Fastify integration" {2-3}
const yoga = createYoga<{
  req: FastifyRequest
  reply: FastifyReply
}>()

// somewhere within the request handler

const response = await yoga.handleNodeRequest(req, {
  req,
  reply
})
```

#### Fetch API Request compliant environments (Cloudflare Workers/Deno)

If you are using
[Cloudflare Workers according to the integration guide](/docs/integrations/integration-with-cloudflare-workers),
the [WHATWG `FetchEvent` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent) will
be added as the server context object. That object is almost identical to what GraphQL Yoga provides
you within `YogaInitialContext`.

### User Context

Besides, the initial context generated based on your setup, GraphQL Yoga also accepts a user context
object that will be merged with the initial context (built out of the default context and server
context). You can pass a factory function to `context` parameter of `createYoga` configuration. That
function will receive the combination of the standard initial context and the server's (if
available), then the return value will be merged into that.

```ts filename="User context factory function" {5-9}
import { createServer } from 'http'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

const yoga = createYoga({
  context: async ({ request }) => {
    // get custom header value
    const foo = request.headers.get('x-foo') ?? null
    return { foo }
  }
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

In this case, your final context object will have an extra `foo` property.

See the above section [extending the initial context](#extending-the-initial-context) for more
details and usage examples.

## Envelop Plugins

After all of the above, Envelop plugins (if you have some) receive the context object and can modify
or extend it. See the documentation for [Envelop plugins](/docs/features/envelop-plugins) for more
information.
