# Configuring CORS with Yoga

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. In a nutshell, as a security measure, browsers aren't allowed to access resources outside their own domain.

If your API and web apps are deployed to different domains (or subdomains), you'll have to worry about CORS. For example, if your web client is deployed to example.com but your Yoga server is api.example.com. For security reasons, your browser will not allow XHR requests (like the kind that the GraphQL client makes) to a domain other than the one currently in the browser's address bar.

To deal with this you have two options:

1. **Avoid CORS by proxying your requests**

If you setup a proxy or redirect to forward requests from `example.com/api/*` to `api.example.com`, you avoid CORS issues all together.

2. **Configure Yoga to send back CORS headers**

Yoga comes with CORS support out of the box - CORS can be configured when creating the server either by passing a CORSOptions object, or a builder function that returns the CORSOptions object.

```ts
export type CORSOptions =
  | {
      origin?: string[] | string
      methods?: string[]
      allowedHeaders?: string[]
      exposedHeaders?: string[]
      credentials?: boolean
      maxAge?: number
    }
  | false
```

### Example Configuration Using `CORSOptions`

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/common'

const yogaApp = createServer({
  cors: {
    origin: 'http://localhost:4000',
    credentials: true,
    allowedHeaders: ['X-Custom-Header'],
    methods: ['POST'],
  },
  /* ...other args */
})
```

This will return the following headers:

```text
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: 'http://localhost:4000'
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Custom-Header
```

### Example Configuration Using Builder Function

You can also pass a function to the cors property, that takes your request and contructs the options

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/common'

const yogaApp = createServer({
  cors(request) {
    const requestOrigin = request.headers.get('origin')
    return {
      origin: requestOrigin,
      credentials: true,
      allowedHeaders: ['X-Custom-Header'],
      methods: ['POST'],
    }
  },
})
```

This will return the same headers as the previous example, but take the `origin` of the request, and return it in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.

## Default CORS setting

By default, GraphQL Yoga will return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` when preflight requests are made.

This means cross-origin requests from browsers work out of the box - however, it may be appropriate to lock to a specific domain before deploying to production.

## Disabling CORS

You can disable CORS on your Yoga server by simply passing `false` as the cors property. For example::

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/common'

const yogaApp = createServer({
  cors: false,
  /* ...other args */
})
```

This will remove all `Access-Control` headers from the response.
