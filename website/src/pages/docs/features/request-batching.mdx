# Batching

Batching is the process of taking a group of requests, combining them into one, and making a single request with the same data that all of the other queries would have made.
This is a way to reduce the number of requests that your application makes to the server.

The Batching functionality is described via the [`Batching RFC`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/rfcs/Batching.md).

## Enable Batching

Batching is disabled by default, but you can enable it by setting the `batching` option to `true`:

```ts filename="Disable batching"
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'node:http'

export const yoga = createYoga<ServerContext, UserContext>({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String!
      }
    `
  }),
  batching: true
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

```bash filename="Execute batched operation"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -d '[{"query": "{ hee: hello }"}, {"query": "{ ho: hello }"}]'
```

## Limit the amount of Batched Requests

By default up to 10 GraphQL requests are allowed within a single HTTP request. If this amount is exceeded an error will be raised.
You can customize this option by passing an object to the `batching` configuration option:

```ts filename="Limit the amount of Batched Requests to 2"
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'node:http'

export const yoga = createYoga<ServerContext, UserContext>({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String!
      }
    `
  }),
  batching: {
    limit: 2
  }
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

```bash filename="Execute batched operation (exceed limit)"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -i http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -d '[{"query": "{ hee: hello }"}, {"query": "{ ho: hello }"}, {"query": "{ holla: hello }"}]'
```

When exceeding the batching limit the HTTP status code will be [`413` (Payload Too Large)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/413).

```json filename="GraphQL Error response"
{
  "errors": [{ "message": "Batching is limited to 2 operations per request." }]
}
```
