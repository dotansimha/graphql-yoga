# Persisted Operations

Persisted operations is a mechanism for preventing the execution of arbitrary GraphQL operation documents.
By default, the persisted operations plugin follows the [the APQ Specification](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-persisted-queries#apollo-engine) for **SENDING** hashes to the server.

However, you can customize the protocol to comply to other implementations e.g. used by [Relay persisted queries](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/persisted-queries/).

change this behavior by overriding the `getPersistedOperationKey` option to support Relay's specification for example.

## Quick Start

Persisted operations requires installing a separate package.

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-yoga/plugin-persisted-operations']} />

```ts filename="Persisted operation setup"
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { usePersistedOperations } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-persisted-operations'

const store = {
  ecf4edb46db40b5132295c0291d62fb65d6759a9eedfa4d5d612dd5ec54a6b38:
    '{__typename}'
}

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String!
      }
    `
  }),
  plugins: [
    usePersistedOperations({
      getPersistedOperation(sha256Hash: string) {
        return store[sha256Hash]
      }
    })
  ]
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

Start your yoga server and send the following request.

```bash filename="Execute persisted GraphQL operation"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -d '{"extensions":{"persistedQuery":{"version":1,"sha256Hash":"ecf4edb46db40b5132295c0291d62fb65d6759a9eedfa4d5d612dd5ec54a6b38"}}}'

{"data":{"__typename":"Query"}}
```

As you can see, the persisted operations plugin is able to execute the operation without the need to send the full operation document.

If you now sent a normal GraphQL operation that is not within the store, it will be rejected.

```bash filename="Arbitary GraphQL operation"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -d '{"query": "{__typename}"}'

{"errors":[{"message":"PersistedQueryOnly"}]}
```

## Extracting client operations

The recommended way of extracting the persisted operations from your client is to use [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/).

<Callout type="info">
  You can learn more about persisted operations with [the `client` preset on the
  GraphQL Code Generator
  documentation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/presets/preset-client#persisted-documents).

There is also [a full code example using GraphQL Yoga available on GitHub](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/tree/master/examples/persisted-documents).

</Callout>

For people not using the client-preset the is also the standalone [`graphql-codegen-persisted-query-ids`](https://github.com/valu-digital/graphql-codegen-persisted-query-ids) plugin for extracting a map of persisted query ids and their corresponding GraphQL documents from your application/client-code in a JSON file.

```json filename="Example map extracted by GraphQL Code Generator"
{
  "ecf4edb46db40b5132295c0291d62fb65d6759a9eedfa4d5d612dd5ec54a6b38": "{__typename}",
  "c7a30a69b731d1af42a4ba02f2fa7a5771b6c44dcafb7c3e5fa4232c012bf5e7": "mutation {__typename}"
}
```

This map can then be used to persist the GraphQL documents in the server.

```ts filename="Use JSON file from filesystem as the persisted operation store"
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'
import { usePersistedOperations } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-persisted-operations'

const persistedOperations = JSON.parse(
  readFileSync('./persistedOperations.json', 'utf-8')
)

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String!
      }
    `
  }),
  plugins: [
    usePersistedOperations({
      getPersistedOperation(key: string) {
        return persistedOperations[key]
      }
    })
  ]
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

## Sending the hash from the client

The persisted operations plugin follows the [the APQ Specification of Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-persisted-queries#apollo-engine) for SENDING hashes to the server.

GraphQL clients such `Apollo Client` and `Urql` support that out of the box.
Check the corresponding documentation for more information.

- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/#step-2-enable-automatic-persisted-queries)
- [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/advanced/persistence-and-uploads/)

## Using parsed GraphQL documents as AST

You can reduce the amount of work the server has to do by using the parsed GraphQL documents as AST.

```ts filename="Use parsed GraphQL documents as AST"
import {
  usePersistedOperations,
  PersistedOperationType
} from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-persisted-operations'
import { parse } from 'graphql'

const persistedOperations = {
  'my-key': parse(/* GraphQL */ `
    query {
      __typename
    }
  `)
}

const plugin = usePersistedOperations({
  getPersistedOperation(key: string) {
    return persistedOperations[key]
  }
})
```

## Skipping validation of persisted operations

If you validate your persisted operations while building your store, we recommend to skip the validation on the server. So this will reduce the work done by the server and the latency of the requests.

```ts filename="Validate persisted operations"
const plugin = usePersistedOperations({
  //...
  skipValidation: true
})
```

> Using AST and skipping validations will reduce the amount of work the server has to do, so the requests will have less latency.

## Allowing arbitrary GraphQL operations

Sometimes it is handy to allow non-persisted operations aside from the persisted ones.
E.g. you want to allow developers to execute arbitrary GraphQL operations on your production server.

This can be achieved using the `allowArbitraryOperations` option.

```ts filename="Allow arbitrary GraphQL operations"
const plugin = usePersistedOperations({
  allowArbitraryOperations: (request) =>
    request.headers.request.headers.get('x-allow-arbitrary-operations') ===
    'true'
})
```

Use this option with caution!

## Using Relay's Persisted Queries Specification

If you are using [Relay's Persisted Queries specification](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/persisted-queries/#example-implemetation-of-relaylocalpersistingjs), you can configure the plugin like below;

```ts filename="Relay Persisted Queries example"
import { createYoga, createSchema } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { usePersistedOperations } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-persisted-operations'

const store = {
  ecf4edb46db40b5132295c0291d62fb65d6759a9eedfa4d5d612dd5ec54a6b38:
    '{__typename}'
}

const yoga = createYoga({
    schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String!
      }
    `
  }),
  plugins: [
    usePersistedOperations({
      extractPersistedOperationId(params: Record<string, unknown>) {
        if (typeof payload.doc_id === 'string') {
          return payload.doc_id
        }
        return null
      }
      getPersistedOperation(key: string) {
        return store[key]
      },
    }),
  ],
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
    console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

## Using an external Persisted Operation Store

As a project grows the amount of GraphQL Clients and GraphQL Operations can grow a lot.
At some point it might become impractible to store all persisted operations in memory.

In such a scenario you can use an external persisted operation store.

You can return a `Promise` from the `getPersistedOperation` function and call any database or external service to retrieve the persisted operation.

<Callout>
  For the best performance a mixture of an LRU in-memory store and external
  persisted operation store is recommended.
</Callout>

```ts filename="Use external persisted operation store"
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { usePersistedOperations } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-persisted-operations'

const yoga = createYoga({
  plugins: [
    usePersistedOperations({
      async getPersistedOperation(key: string) {
        return await fetch(`https://localhost:9999/document/${key}`).then(
          (res) => res.json()
        )
      }
    })
  ]
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```
