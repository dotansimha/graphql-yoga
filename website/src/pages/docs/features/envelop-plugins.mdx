# Envelop Plugins

[Envelop is a lightweight JavaScript (TypeScript) library for customizing the GraphQL execution layer, allowing developers to build, share and compose plugins that enhance the capabilities of your GraphQL server](https://envelop.dev).
GraphQL Yoga uses [Envelop](https://envelop.dev) under the hood so you can easily extend your
server's capabilities with the plugins from [Envelop Ecosystem](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins)

## Example

The following example adds [GraphQL JIT](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/graphql-jit) to our
GraphQL Server using [Envelop GraphQL JIT Plugin](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins/use-graphql-jit)

```ts
import { useGraphQlJit } from '@envelop/graphql-jit'
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [useGraphQlJit()]
})

// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```
