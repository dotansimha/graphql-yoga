# Apollo Federation

[Apollo Federation](https://apollographql.com/docs/federation) is a specification that applies
microservice architecture through GraphQL APIs.

Thanks to [Envelop's Apollo Federation](https://envelop.dev/plugins/use-apollo-federation) plugin,
we can use GraphQL Yoga to build our gateway server.

<Callout>
  As documented in the [Apollo Federation
  docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/gateway/#setup), `@apollo/gateway` package
  doesn't support GraphQL v16 so you have to install `graphql@15`.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  Please note that Apollo Federation implementation doesn't support GraphQL Subscriptions. If you
  need to use Subscriptions with a Federated Gateway you can use [Schema
  Stitching](https://graphql-tools.com/docs/schema-stitching/stitch-federation).
</Callout>

## Gateway

You can use GraphQL Yoga to implement a Gateway exposing an Apollo Federation supergraph. For this,
the gateway needs to have access to the supergraph SDL.

You have the choice between loading it from a schema registry (like Hive or Apollo GraphOS) or
locally from the file system.

### Using Hive

Hive is a schema registry and usage reporting plateform for GraphQL. You can use it to manage an
Apollo Federation supergraph.

For a full step by step setup getting started, please follow this
[Apollo Federation usage guide](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/get-started/apollo-federation).

#### Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i graphql-yoga graphql @graphql-yoga/hive
```

#### Example

```js filename="src/index.mjs"
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { createSupergraphSDLFetcher } from '@graphql-hive/client'

const supergraphFetcher = createSupergraphSDLFetcher({
  key: env.HIVE_CDN_KEY,
  endpoint: env.HIVE_CDN_URL
})
const { supergraphSdl } = await supergraphFetcher()

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: getStitchedSchemaFromSupergraphSdl({ supergraphSdl })
})

const server = createServer(yoga)

server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

> You can also check the
> [Hive plugin documentation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/integrations/graphql-yoga) for
> more information

#### Configuration

A full configuration guide can be found in
[Hive's “Configuration”](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/api-reference/client#configuration)
page.

### Using Apollo Managed Federation

Apollo GraphOS can be used as a schema registry when using Managed Federation.

You can use GraphQL Yoga to implement a Gateway exposing the Managed Federation supergraph stored in
GraphOS by using `@graphql-yoga/apollo-managed-federation`. This plugin will automatically fetch the
supergraph SDL from GraphOS, sticth it into an executable schema and serve it.

It also starts a polling mechanism to keep the schema up to date in the background and handle retry
on failure.

#### Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i graphql-yoga graphql @graphql-yoga/apollo-managed-federation
```

#### Example

```js filename="src/index.mjs"
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { useManagedFederation } from '@graphql-yoga/apollo-managed-federation'

const yoga = createYoga({
  plugins: [useManagedFederation()]
})

const server = createServer(yoga)

server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000')
})

process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  server.close()
})
```

> You can also check a full example on our GitHub repository
> [here](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga/tree/main/examples/apollo-managed-federation)

#### Configuration

By default, the plugin will use standard Apollo GraphOS environment variables.

```bash
APOLLO_KEY='<YOU_APOLLO_API_KEY>' APOLLO_GRAPH_REF='<YOUR_GRAPH_ID>[@<VARIANT>]' node src/index.mjs
```

If you don't know where to find these values, please refer to the
[Apollo GraphOS documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/setup#4-connect-your-router-to-graphos).

You can also provide this configuration programaitically by providing a configurtion object to the
plugin, along with other options to customize the polling/retry behavior.

```js
const yoga = createYoga({
  plugins: [
    useManagedFederation({
      apiKey: '<YOU_APOLLO_API_KEY>',
      graphRef: '<YOUR_GRAPH_ID>[@<VARIANT>]',
      maxRetries: 5, // max retries in case of loading failure
      retryDelaySeconds: 0, // delay between retries
      minDelaySeconds: 1 // minimum delay between polling requests
    })
  ]
})
```

Other more advanced options are available, please refer to the type definitions for more
information.

### Using the file system

To create a gateway server without using Apollo GraphOS, you can use the `@graphql-tools/federation`
which can generate an executable schema from a supergraph SDL.

#### Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i graphql-yoga graphql @graphql-tools/federation
```

#### Example

To generate the schema, we first need the supergraph SDL. This can be generated by the Apollo Rover
CLI or fetched from a schema registry (like Hive or Apollo GraphOS).

To generate the supergraph SDL locally, you first have to define a supergraph configuration by
creating a `supergraph.yaml` file.

```yaml filename="supergraph.yaml"
subgraphs:
  accounts:
    routing_url: http://localhost:4001/graphql
    schema:
      file: ./services/accounts.graphql
  inventory:
    routing_url: http://localhost:4002/graphql
    schema:
      file: ./services/inventory.graphql
```

You can then use the Apollo Rover CLI to generate the supergraph SDL.

```bash
rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph.yaml > supergraph.graphql
```

You can now serve the gateway using GraphQL Yoga.

```ts filename="src/index.mjs"
import { readFileSync } from 'fs'
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { getStitchedSchemaFromSupergraphSdl } from '@graphql-tools/federation'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: getStitchedSchemaFromSupergraphSdl({
    // This doesn't have to be from a file system, it can be fetched via HTTP from a schema registry
    supergraphSdl: readFileSync('./supergraph.graphql', 'utf-8')
  })
})

const server = createServer(yoga)

server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql`)
})
```

### Handling Subgraph Errors

By default, GraphQL Yoga masks any unexpected GraphQL Errors. This is done to prevent leaking
internal errors to the client. If you know that your subgraph is safe and you want to expose the
errors to the client, you can customize the error masking bahviour.

[Learn more about error masking](/docs/features/error-masking)

```ts filename="Expose subgraph errors to the client"
import { createYoga, maskError } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { schema } from './schema.js'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema,
  maskedErrors: {
    maskError(error, message, isDev) {
      if (error?.extensions?.code === 'DOWNSTREAM_SERVICE_ERROR') {
        return error
      }

      return maskError(error, message, isDev)
    }
  }
})
```

## Federation Service

You don't need any extra plugins for Yoga for Federation Service.

### Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i graphql-yoga @apollo/subgraph graphql
```

### Example User Service

```ts
const { parse } = require('graphql')
const { buildSubgraphSchema } = require('@apollo/subgraph')
const { createYoga } = require('graphql-yoga')
const { createServer } = require('http')

const typeDefs = parse(/* GraphQL */ `
  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    username: String
  }
`)

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me() {
      return { id: '1', username: '@ava' }
    }
  },
  User: {
    __resolveReference(user, { fetchUserById }) {
      return fetchUserById(user.id)
    }
  }
}
const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: buildSubgraphSchema([{ typeDefs, resolvers }])
})

const server = createServer(yoga)

server.listen(4001, () => {
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at http://localhost:4001`)
})
```

## Federated tracing

Inject additional metrics for
[Apollo's federated tracing](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/metrics/).

You'll need the `@graphql-yoga/plugin-apollo-inline-trace` Yoga plugin for this.

### Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i graphql-yoga @graphql-yoga/plugin-apollo-inline-trace graphql
```

### Example Federated tracing

```ts
import { createServer } from 'http'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { useApolloInlineTrace } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-apollo-inline-trace'

const yoga = createYoga({
  plugins: [
    useApolloInlineTrace()
    // ...rest of your Apollo federation plugins
  ]
})

// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```
