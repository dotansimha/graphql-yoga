# Response Caching

Response caching is a technique for reducing server load by caching GraphQL query operation results.
For incoming GraphQL Query operations with the same variable values, the same response is returned
from a cache instead of executed again.

## Quick Start

The response cache is a separate package that needs to be installed.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @graphql-yoga/plugin-response-cache
```

The following sample setup show as slow field resolver (`Query.slow`).

```ts filename="Response cache example" {14-17,22-25}
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { useResponseCache } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-response-cache'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        slow: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        slow: async () => {
          await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000))
          return 'I am slow.'
        }
      }
    }
  }),
  plugins: [
    useResponseCache({
      // global cache
      session: () => null
    })
  ]
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

After starting the server we can execute a GraphQL Query operation, that selects the `Query.slow`
field.

```sh filename="Execute slow GraphQL Query Operation with cUrl"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -d '{"query":"{slow}"}' -w '\nTotal time : %{time_total}'
```

The output will look similar to the following:

```sh filename="Initial Request time"
{"data":{"slow":"I am slow."}}
Total time:5.026632
```

After executing the same curl statement a second time, the duration is significantly lower.

```sh filename="Cached Request time"
{"data":{"slow":"I am slow."}}
Total time:0.007571%
```

## Session based caching

If your GraphQL API returns specific data depending on the viewer's session, you can use the
`session` option to cache the response per session. Usually, the session is determined by an HTTP
header, e.g. an user id within the encoded access token.

The `session` function receives a `request` parameter that is a
[`Request` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request).

```ts filename="Response Cache configuration based on  header"
useResponseCache({
  // cache based on the authentication header
  session: request => request.headers.get('authentication')
})
```

## Time to Live (TTL)

It is possible to give cached operations a time to live. Either globally, based on
[schema coordinates](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/SchemaCoordinates.md) or
object types.

If a query operation result contains multiple objects of the same or different types, the lowest TTL
is picked.

### Using plugin configuration

```ts filename="Response Cache configuration with TTL"
useResponseCache({
  session: () => null,
  // by default cache all operations for 2 seconds
  ttl: 2_000,
  ttlPerType: {
    // only cache query operations containing User for 500ms
    User: 500
  },
  ttlPerSchemaCoordinate: {
    // cache operations selecting Query.lazy for 10 seconds
    'Query.lazy': 10_000
  }
})
```

### Using Schema directive directive `@cacheControl`

For a schema first approach, the `@cacheControl` directive can be used to define the TTL.

Notice that the global default TTL can only be define in the plugin options `ttl` and not via the
directive.

```ts filenmae="Response Cache configuration with TTL using @cacheControl directive"
import { cacheControlDirective } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-response-cache'

const typeDefs = /* GraphQL */ `
  # the directive needs to be defined in the schema
  ${cacheControlDirective}

  type Query {
    # cache operations selecting Query.lazy for 10 seconds
    lazy: Something @cacheControl(maxAge: 10000)
  }

  # only cache query operations containing User for 500ms
  type User @cacheControl(maxAge: 500) {
    #...
  }
`
```

## Invalidations via Mutation

When executing a mutation operation the cached query results that contain type entities within the
Mutation result will be automatically be invalidated.

```graphql filename="GraphQL mutation operation"
mutation UpdateUser {
  updateUser(id: 1, newName: "John") {
    __typename
    id
    name
  }
}
```

```json filename="GraphQL operation execution result"
{
  "data": {
    "updateLaunch": {
      "__typename": "User",
      "id": "1",
      "name": "John"
    }
  }
}
```

For the given GraphQL operation and execution result all cached query results that contain the type
`User` with the id `1` will be invalidated.

This behavior can be disabled by setting the `invalidateViaMutation` option to `false`.

```ts filename="Disabling mutation invalidation"
useResponseCache({
  session: request => null,
  invalidateViaMutation: false
})
```

## Manual Invalidation

You can invalidate a type or specific instances of a type using the cache invalidation API.

In order to use the API, you need to manually instantiate the cache an pass it to the
`useResponseCache` plugin.

```ts filename="Manual cache construction" {3,6}
import { createInMemoryCache, useResponseCache } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-response-cache'

const cache = createInMemoryCache()

useResponseCache({
  session: () => null,
  cache
})
```

Then in your business logic you can call the `invalidate` method on the cache instance.

Invalidate all GraphQL query results that reference a specific type:

```ts filename="Invalidating a type"
cache.invalidate([{ type: 'User' }])
```

Invalidate all GraphQL query results that reference a specific entity of a type:

```ts filename="Invalidate a specific entity of a type"
cache.invalidate([{ type: 'User', id: '1' }])
```

Invalidate all GraphQL query results multiple entities in a single call.

```ts filename="Invalidate multiple entities"
cache.invalidate([
  { type: 'Post', id: '1' },
  { type: 'User', id: '2' }
])
```

## External Cache

By default, the response cache stores all the cached query results in memory.

If you want a cache that is shared between multiple server instances you can use the Redis cache
implementation, which is available as a separate package.

<Callout>The Redis cache currently only works in Node.js environments.</Callout>

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @envelop/response-cache-redis
```

```ts filename="Create a custom Redis Cache"
import { useResponseCache } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-response-cache'
import { createRedisCache } from '@envelop/response-cache-redis'
import Redis from 'ioredis'

const redis = new Redis({
  host: 'my-redis-db.example.com',
  port: '30652',
  password: '1234567890'
})

const redis = new Redis('redis://:1234567890@my-redis-db.example.com:30652')

const cache = createRedisCache({ redis })

useResponseCache({
  session: () => null,
  cache
})
```

## HTTP Caching via `ETag` and `If-None-Match` headers

Response Caching plugin sends `ETag` headers to the client, and respects `If-None-Match` headers in
the HTTP request.

If the client sends an `If-None-Match` header with the same value as the `ETag` header, the server
will respond with a `304 Not Modified` status code without any content, which allows you to reduce
the server load.

Most of the browsers and some HTTP clients support this behavior, so you can use it to improve the
performance of your frontend application.

[Learn more about `ETag` and `If-None-Match` headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag).

### Example with `curl`

First we send a request to the GraphQL server, and we can see that the response contains the headers

```bash filename="Get ETag and Last-Modified headers"
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  "http://localhost:4000/graphql?query={me{id name}}" -v
```

Then the server will respond a data something the following with the `ETag` and `Last-Modified`
headers:

- `ETag` is the key that is used to identify the cached response.
- `Last-Modified` is used to determine if the cached response is still valid.

```bash filename="Response with ETag and Last-Modified headers"
> GET /graphql?query={me{id,name}} HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:4000
> User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
> Accept: application/json
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< access-control-allow-origin: *
< content-length: 130
< content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
< etag: 2c0ebfe7b2b0273029f2fa23a99d213b56f4838756b3ef7b323c04de1e836be3
< last-modified: Wed Feb 15 2023 15:23:55 GMT+0300 (GMT+03:00)
< Date: Wed, 15 Feb 2023 12:23:55 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
< Keep-Alive: timeout=5
<

{"data":{"me":{"id":"1","name":"Bob"}}}
```

In the next calls, we can use the `ETag` header as the `If-None-Match` header together with
`Last-Modified` header as `If-Modified-Since` to check if the cached response is still valid.

```bash filename="Use the headers to check if the cached response is still valid"
curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "If-None-Match: 2c0ebfe7b2b0273029f2fa23a99d213b56f4838756b3ef7b323c04de1e836be3" \
  -H "If-Modified-Since: Wed Feb 15 2023 15:23:55 GMT" \
  "http://localhost:4000/graphql?query=\{me\{id,name\}\}" -v
```

Then the server will return `304: Not Modified` status code with no content.
