# Introspection

A powerful feature of GraphQL is schema introspection.
This feature is used by GraphiQL for exploring the schema and also by tooling such as [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) for generating type-safe client/frontend code.

GraphQL schema introspection is also a feature that allows clients to ask a GraphQL server what GraphQL features it supports (e.g. defer/stream or subscriptions).

## Disabling Introspection

<Callout>
  If your goal is to avoid unknown actors from reverse-engineering your GraphQL
  schema and executing arbitrary operations, it is highly recommended to use
  persisted operations.

```ts "Disabling GraphQL schema introspection with a plugin" {7}
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { useDisableIntrospection } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-disable-introspection'

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  graphiql: false,
  plugins: [useDisableIntrospection()]
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

## Disable Introspection based on the GraphQL Request

Sometimes you want to allow introspectition for certain users.
You can access the `Request` object and determine based on that whether introspection should be enabled or not.
E.g. you can check the headers.

```ts "Disabling GraphQL schema introspection conditionally" {7}
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { useDisableIntrospection } from '@graphql-yoga/plugin-disable-introspection'

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  graphiql: false,
  plugins: [
    useDisableIntrospection({
      isDisabled: (request) =>
        request.headers.get('x-allow-introspection') !== 'secret-access-key'
    })
  ]
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

## Disabling Field Suggestions

When executing invalid GraphQL operation the GraphQL engine will try to construct smart suggestions that hint typos in the executed GraphQL document.
This can be considered a security issue, as it can leak information about the GraphQL schema, even if introspection is disabled.

Disabling the "did you mean x" suggestion feature can be achieved via the `blockFieldSuggestionsPlugin` from [`graphql-armor`](https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/graphql-armor).

<PackageCmd packages={['@escape.tech/graphql-armor-block-field-suggestions']} />

```ts filename="Disabling the 'did you mean x' suggestion feature with a plugin" {2, 7}
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { blockFieldSuggestionsPlugin } from '@escape.tech/graphql-armor-block-field-suggestions'

// Provide your schema
const yoga = createYoga({
  graphiql: false,
  plugins: [useDisableIntrospection(), blockFieldSuggestionsPlugin()]
})

const server = createServer(yoga)
server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```
