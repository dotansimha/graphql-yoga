# Testing

GraphQL Yoga makes it easy to test your GraphQL API. It has built-in support for HTTP injection. You
can use any testing framework of your choice.

You can use the `fetch` method on your yoga instance for calling the yoga instance as if you were
doing an HTTP request.

```ts
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { schema } from './schema'

const yoga = createYoga({ schema })

const response = await yoga.fetch('http://localhost:4000/graphql', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: '{ greetings }',
  }),
})

console.assert(response.status === 200, 'Response status should be 200')
const executionResult = await response.json()
console.assert(
  executionResult.data.greetings ===
    'This is the `greetings` field of the root `Query` type',
  `Expected 'This is the `greetings` field of the root `Query` type' but got ${executionResult.data.greetings}`,
)
```
