# Envelop Plugins

[Envelop](https://envelop.dev) is a lightweight JavaScript (TypeScript) library for customizing the
GraphQL execution layer, allowing developers to build, share and compose plugins that enhance the
capabilities of your GraphQL server. GraphQL Yoga uses Envelop under the hood, so you can easily
extend your server's capabilities with
[the plugins from Envelop Ecosystem](https://envelop.dev/plugins)

## Example

The following example adds [GraphQL JIT](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/graphql-jit) to our
GraphQL Server using [Envelop GraphQL JIT Plugin](https://envelop.dev/plugins/use-graphql-jit):

```ts
import { useGraphQlJit } from '@envelop/graphql-jit'
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

// Provide your schema
const server = createServer({
  schema: {
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello World!'
      }
    }
  },
  plugins: [useGraphQlJit()]
})

// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```
