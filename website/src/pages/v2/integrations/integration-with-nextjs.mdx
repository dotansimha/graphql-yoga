# Integration with Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is a web framework that allows you to build websites very quickly and GraphQL Yoga can be integrated with Next.js easily as [an API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/api-middlewares).

## Installation

<PackageCmd packages={['@graphql-yoga/node graphql']} />

## Example

```ts filename="pages/aрi/graphql.ts"
// Next.js API route support: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'

export const config = {
  api: {
    // Disable body parsing (required for file uploads)
    bodyParser: false
  }
}

export default createServer<{
  req: NextApiRequest
  res: NextApiResponse
}>()
```

  You can also check a full example on our GitHub repository
  [here](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga/tree/v2/examples/nextjs).

## NextAuth.js

[NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) is a popular solution for doing authentication within a Next.js application.

You can easily type and add the session to the GraphQL context by adjusting your GraphQL router handler to the following.

```ts filename="pages/aрi/graphql.ts"
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'
import type { Session } from 'next-auth'
import { getSession } from 'next-auth/react'

export const config = {
  api: {
    // Disable body parsing (required for file uploads)
    bodyParser: false
  }
}

export default createServer<
  {
    req: NextApiRequest
    res: NextApiResponse
  },
  {
    session: Session
  }
>({
  context: async ({ req }) => {
    return {
      session: await getSession({ req })
    }
  }
})
```
