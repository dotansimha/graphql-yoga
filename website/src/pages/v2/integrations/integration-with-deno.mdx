# Integration with Deno

GraphQL Yoga provides you a cross-platform GraphQL Server. So you can easily integrate it into any platform besides Node.js.
[Deno](https://deno.land) is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.
But instead of `graphql-yoga` npm package, we will use `@graphql-yoga/common` which has an agnostic HTTP handler using [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)'s [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects.

## Example

```ts filename="deno-example.ts"
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts'
import { createServer } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@graphql-yoga/common'

const graphQLServer = createServer()

serve(graphQLServer, { port: 4000 })

console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
```
