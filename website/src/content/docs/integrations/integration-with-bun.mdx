# Integration with Bun

GraphQL Yoga provides you a cross-platform GraphQL Server. So you can easily integrate it into any
platform besides Node.js. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a modern JavaScript runtime like Node or Deno,
and it supports Fetch API as a first class citizen. So the configuration is really simple like any
other JS runtime with Yoga;

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i graphql-yoga graphql
```

## Usage

The following code is a simple example of how to use GraphQL Yoga with Bun.

```ts
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        greetings: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        greetings: () => 'Hello from Yoga in a Bun app!'
      }
    }
  })
})

const server = Bun.serve({
  fetch: yoga
})

console.info(
  `Server is running on ${new URL(
    yoga.graphqlEndpoint,
    `http://${server.hostname}:${server.port}`
  )}`
)
```
