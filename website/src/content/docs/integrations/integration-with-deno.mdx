# Integration with Deno

GraphQL Yoga provides you a cross-platform GraphQL Server. So you can easily integrate it into any
platform besides Node.js.
[Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust](https://deno.land/).
We will use `graphql-yoga` which has an agnostic HTTP handler using
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)'s
[`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and
[`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects.

## Example

Create a Deno project:

```bash
deno init my-project
cd my-project
```

Add `graphql-yoga` to the project:

```bash
deno add npm:graphql-yoga
```

Create a `deno-yoga.ts` file:

```ts filename="deno-yoga.ts"
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String!
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        hello: () => 'Hello Deno!'
      }
    }
  })
})

Deno.serve({ port: 4000 }, yoga)
```

And run it:

```bash
deno run --allow-net deno-yoga.ts
```
