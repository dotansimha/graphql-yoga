Now that you have a GraphQL schema, and you understand the concept of GraphQL schema and a GraphQL query, it's time to create a real GraphQL server.

You are going to use the HTTP protocol to serve the GraphQL server, but note that there are other options for serving GraphQL - you can use WebSocket, SSE (Server-Sent Events) and basically any network transport protocol that you wish! (You can find a list of transport implementations at the end of this page)

### Creating a GraphQL HTTP server with Yoga

In this tutorial, we will be using `@graphql-yoga/node` for building our Node.js GraphQL HTTP server.

> Yoga can also run on other platforms, such as Cloudflare Workers or deno. [We recommend checking out the integrations section in our documentation after finishing the tutorial.](/docs/integrations/integration-with-cloudflare-workers)

<Instruction>

You'll need the `@graphql-yoga/node` package available in your project, so install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install --save --exact @graphql-yoga/node
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Now, update `src/main.ts` to create a simple GraphQL HTTP server on port `4000`:

```typescript
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
import { schema } from './schema'

async function main() {
  const server = createServer({ schema })
  await server.start()
}

main()
```

</Instruction>

Now, try to run your server again with `npm run dev` (or, `npm run start`).

The output should look similar to the following:

```bash
$ cross-env NODE_ENV=development ts-node-dev --exit-child --respawn src/main.ts
[INFO] 15:40:14 ts-node-dev ver. 1.1.8 (using ts-node ver. 9.1.1, typescript ver. 4.5.5)
[2022-02-25 14:40:17.810 +0000] DEBUG (13296 on DESKTOP-U72CGKK): Setting up server.
[2022-02-25 14:40:17.818 +0000] INFO (13296 on DESKTOP-U72CGKK): GraphQL Server running at http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql.
```

Now open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.

TODO: INSERT GRAPHIQL SCREENSHOT HERE

<Instruction>

Type in the following operation in the left editor section and press the `Play` button for executing the operation against the GraphQL server.

```graphql
query {
  hello
}
```

</Instruction>

Unsurprisingly, the result looks like the following:

```json
{ "data": { "hello": "Hello World!" } }
```

Of course it is also possible to send requests to the service without GraphiQL, e.g. by using `curl`.

<Instruction>

Run the following command within your terminal for executing the same query operation.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/graphql -H "Content-type: application/json" --data-raw '{"query": "query { hello }"}'
```

</Instruction>

Oh wonder, the result looks like the following:

```json
{ "data": { "hello": "Hello World!" } }
```
