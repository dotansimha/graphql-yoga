Now that you have a GraphQL schema, and you understand the concept of GraphQL schema and a GraphQL query, it's time to create a real GraphQL server.

You are going to use the HTTP protocol to serve the GraphQL server, but note that there are other options for serving GraphQL - you can use WebSocket, SSE (Server-Sent Events) and basically any network transport protocol that you wish! (You can find a list of transport implementations at the end of this page)

### Creating a GraphQL HTTP server with Yoga

In this tutorial, we will be using `@graphql-yoga/node` for building our Node.js GraphQL HTTP server.

<Instruction>

You'll need the `@graphql-yoga/node` package available in your project, so install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install --save --exact @graphql-yoga/node
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Now, update `src/main.ts` to create a simple GraphQL HTTP server on port `3000`:

```typescript
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
import { schema } from './schema'

async function main() {
  const server = createServer({ schema })
  await server.start()
}

main()
```

</Instruction>

> You've removed the previous GraphQL setup from this file, but don't worry - in a few minutes you'll add it with more capabilities and a real server!

Now, try to run your server again with `npm run dev` (or, `npm run start`). You shouldn't see any special output in the log, but you can now open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.

You can now try to run your server, and you should be able to run our query in a HTTP-based GraphQL request.

<Instruction>

If you have `curl` installed on your machine, you should be able to run and see the GraphQL response (you can also use any kind of HTTP requests tools, like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/graphql -H "Content-type: application/json" --data-raw '{"query": "query { info }"}'
```

And you should see in return:

```(nocopy)
{ "data": { "info": "Test" } }
```

</Instruction>
