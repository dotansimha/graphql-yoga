### Overview

GraphQL is the rising star of backend technologies. It's a popular alternative for REST as an API design paradigm and is becoming the new
standard for exposing the data and functionality of a web server.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a GraphQL HTTP server entirely from scratch.

You are going to use the following technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - as an engine and runtime for our server.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - a strongly typed programming language which builds on JavaScript giving you better tooling at any scale.
- `graphql-yoga`- the easiest way of build an HTTP GraphQL server.
- [`graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) - we will use the core `graphql` library as execution engine for our server.
- [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql): A graphical interface that allows you to interactively
  explore the functionality of a GraphQL API by sending query, mutation and subscription operations. It's somewhat similar to
  [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) which offers comparable functionality for REST APIs. Among other things,
  GraphiQL:
  - Auto-generates comprehensive documentation for all available API operations.
  - Provides an editor where you can write queries, mutations & subscriptions with auto-complete and syntax
    highlighting.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/): A lightweight and easy to use relational database management system for persisting data on the file system.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): The glue between your code and SQLite database. Use Prisma Client to access your database inside of
  GraphQL resolvers.

You can find the [code of the tutorial in this repository](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga/tree/master/examples/hackernews-node-ts).

### What to expect

The goal of this tutorial is to build an API for a [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) clone. Here is a quick
rundown of what to expect.

You'll start by learning the basics of how a GraphQL server works, simply by defining a
[_GraphQL schema_](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e) for the server and writing
corresponding _resolver functions_ for retrieving data. In the beginning, these resolvers will only work with data that's stored in-memory -
so nothing will persist beyond the runtime of the server.

Nobody wants a server that's not able to store and persist data, right? Not to worry! Next, you're going to add a
[SQLite](http://sqlite.org/) database to the project which will be accessed using [Prisma 3](https://www.prisma.io/).

Once you have the database connected, you are going to add more advanced features to the API.

You'll start by implementing signup/login functionality that enables users to authenticate against the API. This will
also allow you to check the permissions of your users for certain API operations.

Next, we will make a part of the API real-time by adding GraphQL subscriptions!

Finally, you'll allow the consumers of the API to constrain the list of items they retrieve from the API by adding
filtering and pagination capabilities to it.
