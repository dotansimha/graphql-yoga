GraphQL Yoga provides you a cross-platform GraphQL Server. So you can easily integrate it into any platform besides Node.js.

[Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers) provides a serverless execution environment that allows you to create entirely new applications or augment existing ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure.

You will want to use the package `@graphql-yoga/common` which has an agnostic HTTP handler using [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)'s [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects when building GraphQL powered Cloudflare Workers.

## Installation

<PackageInstall packages={['graphql', '@graphql-yoga/common']} />

## Example with regular `fetch` event listener

`listener.mjs`

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/common'

const server = createServer()

server.start()
```

> You can also check a full example on our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga/tree/master/examples/service-worker)

## Example with Modules Approach

`modules.mjs`

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/common'

const yoga = createServer()

export default {
  fetch: yoga.fetch,
}
```

If you need `env`, or `ctx` inside your resolvers, you can set the `context` on your GraphQL server similar to what you see here:

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/common'

interface Env {
  MY_NAMESPACE: KVNamespace
}

const yoga = createServer<{ env: Env; ctx: ExecutionContext }>()

const fetch = async (req: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) =>
  await server.handleRequest(req, { env, ctx })

export default {
  fetch,
}
```

## Enabling Subscriptions

In order to enable Server Sent Events based subscriptions with Cloudflare Workers, you should add a compatibility flag in your wrangler configuration file like below;

```toml
compatibility_flags = ["streams_enable_constructors"]
```

## Debug Logging

You should expose `DEBUG` variable in your environment to enable more verbose logging from GraphQL Yoga application.
