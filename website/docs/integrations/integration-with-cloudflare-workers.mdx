GraphQL Yoga provides you a cross-platform GraphQL Server. So you can easily integrate it into any platform besides Node.js.
[Cloudflare Workers provides a serverless execution environment that allows you to create entirely new applications or augment existing ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).
But instead of `graphql-yoga` npm package, we will use `@graphql-yoga/common` which has an agnostic HTTP handler using [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)'s [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects.

## Installation

<PackageInstall packages={['graphql', '@graphql-yoga/common']} />

## Example with regular `fetch` event listener

`listener.mjs`

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/common'

const server = createServer()

server.start()
```

> You can also check a full example on our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga/tree/master/examples/service-worker)

## Example with Modules Approach

`modules.mjs`

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/common'

const yoga = createServer()

export default yoga
```

## Enabling Subscriptions

In order to enable Server Sent Events based subscriptions with Cloudflare Workers, you should add a compatibility flag in your wrangler configuration file like below;

```toml
compatibility_flags = ["streams_enable_constructors"]
```

## Debug Logging

You should expose `DEBUG` variable in your environment to enable more verbose logging from GraphQL Yoga application.
