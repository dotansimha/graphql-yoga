[Koa is a new web framework designed by the team behind Express, which aims to be a smaller, more expressive, and more robust foundation for web applications and APIs.](https://koajs.com/)
GraphQL Yoga can be integrated easily as a route to the existing Koa application with a few lines of code. [So you can benefit middlewares written for Koa with GraphQL Yoga.](https://github.com/koajs/koa/wiki)

## Installation

<PackageInstall packages={['koa', 'graphql', 'graphql-yoga@alpha']} />

## Example

```ts
import Koa from 'koa'
import { GraphQLServer } from 'graphql-yoga'

const app = new Koa()

const graphQLServer = new GraphQLServer({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    type Query {
      hello: String
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      hello: () => 'world',
    },
  },
})

// Bind GraphQL Yoga to `/graphql` endpoint
// Here it takes the request and response objects and handles them internally
app.use('/graphql', async (ctx) => {
  ctx.req.socket.setTimeout(0)
  ctx.req.socket.setNoDelay(true)
  ctx.req.socket.setKeepAlive(true)

  return graphQLServer.requestListener(ctx.request, ctx.res)
})

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```
