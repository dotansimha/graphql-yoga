You can easily integrate GraphQL Yoga into your Express application with a few lines of code.

<PackageInstall packages={['express', 'graphql', 'graphql-yoga']} />

## Example

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

const app = express()

const yoga = createYoga()

// Bind GraphQL Yoga to `/graphql` endpoint
app.use('/graphql', yoga)

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```
