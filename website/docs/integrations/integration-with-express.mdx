[Express is the most popular web framework for Node.js.](https://expressjs.com/) It is a minimalist framework that provides a robust set of features to handle HTTP on Node.js applications.
You can easily integrate GraphQL Yoga into your Express application with a few lines of code.

## Installation

<PackageInstall packages={['express', 'graphql', '@graphql-yoga/node@beta']} />

## Example

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

const app = express()

const graphQLServer = createServer()

// Bind GraphQL Yoga to `/graphql` endpoint
app.use('/graphql', graphQLServer)

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```
