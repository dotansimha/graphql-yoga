[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a web framework that allows you to build websites very quickly and GraphQL Yoga can be integrated with Next.js easily as [an API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/api-middlewares).

## Installation

<PackageInstall packages={['graphql', 'graphql-yoga']} />

## Example

`pages/api/graphql.ts`

```ts
// Next.js API route support: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'

export const config = {
  api: {
    // Disable body parsing (required for file uploads)
    bodyParser: false,
  },
}

export default createYoga<{
  req: NextApiRequest
  res: NextApiResponse
}>()
```
