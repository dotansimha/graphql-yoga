[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a web framework that allows you to build websites very quickly and GraphQL Yoga can be integrated with Next.js easily as [an API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/api-middlewares).

## Installation

<PackageInstall packages={['graphql', '@graphql-yoga/node']} />

## Example

`pages/api/graphql.ts`

```ts
// Next.js API route support: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'

const server = createServer<{
  req: NextApiRequest
  res: NextApiResponse
}>()

export default server
```
