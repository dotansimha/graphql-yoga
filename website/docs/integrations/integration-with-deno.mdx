GraphQL Yoga provides you a cross-platform GraphQL Server. So you can easily integrate it into any platform besides Node.js.
[Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust](https://deno.land/).
We will use `graphql-yoga` which has an agnostic HTTP handler using [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)'s [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects.

## Example

`deno-example.ts`

```ts
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.117.0/http/server.ts'
import { createYoga } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/graphql-yoga?dts'

const yoga = createYoga()

serve(yoga, {
  addr: ':4000',
})

console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
```
