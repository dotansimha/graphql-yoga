GraphQL Yoga is a batteries-included cross-platform [GraphQL over HTTP spec-compliant](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http) GraphQL Server using [GraphQL Helix](https://www.graphql-helix.com/), [Envelop](https://envelop.dev) and [GraphQL Tools](https://graphql-tools.com).

## Installation

> When using Node.js we recommend at least using version **16**. Using an older LTS version (such as 14) is still possible, but requires polyfilling APIs when using some features of GraphQL Yoga. You will receive user-friendly error messages that guide you on installing those polyfills.

<PackageInstall packages={['graphql', 'graphql-yoga@alpha']} />

## Create a Hello World GraphQL API

The following example shows how to create a simple GraphQL Yoga server that responds to a simple query, and it uses `typeDefs` and `resolvers` pattern of GraphQL Tools.
You can [learn more on GraphQL Tools documentation](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/generate-schema) how to create a schema using this pattern.

```ts
import { GraphQLServer } from 'graphql-yoga'

// Provide your schema
const server = new GraphQLServer({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    type Query {
      greetings: String!
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      greetings: () => 'Hello World!',
    },
  },
})
// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```

## Passing an executable schema created by other tools

You can pass existing `GraphQLSchema` instance to `GraphQLServer` constructor like the following example;

```ts
import { schema } from './schema'
import { GraphQLYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

const server = new GraphQLYoga({
  schema,
})

server.start()
```
