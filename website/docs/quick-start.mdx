GraphQL Yoga is a batteries-included cross-platform [GraphQL over HTTP spec-compliant](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http) GraphQL Server using [Envelop](https://envelop.dev) and [GraphQL Tools](https://graphql-tools.com).

## Installation

> When using Node.js we recommend using version **17** with `--experimental-fetch` flag. Using an older LTS version (such as 14) is still possible, but requires polyfilling APIs when using some features of GraphQL Yoga. You will receive user-friendly error messages that guide you on installing those polyfills.

<PackageInstall packages={['graphql', '@graphql-yoga/node']} />

## Create a Hello World GraphQL API

The following example shows how to create a simple GraphQL Yoga server that responds to a simple query.

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

// Create your server
const server = createServer({})
// start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```

That is it!

Now visit `http://localhost:4000/graphql` in your browser and execute the followiing query operation:

```graphql
query HelloWorld {
  hello
}
```

## Provide your own GraphQL schema

You probably want to write your own schema instead of using the hello world schema that is served by default!

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

// Create your server
const server = createServer({
  schema: {
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        hello: () => 'Hello Hello Hello',
      },
    },
  },
})
// start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```

You can simply provide type definitions and a resolver map based on the popular graphql-tools `makeExecutableSchema` pattern. You can [learn more on the GraphQL Tools documentation](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/generate-schema)

## Passing an executable schema created by other tools

You can also pass an existing `GraphQLSchema` instance to `createServer`.
Use your favorite schema building library such as [Pothos](https://pothos-graphql.dev/), [gqtx](https://github.com/sikanhe/gqtx), [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexusjs.org/) or plain [graphql-js schema classes](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema).

```ts
import { schema } from './schema'
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

const server = createServer({
  schema,
})
// start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```
