[Envelop is a lightweight JavaScript (TypeScript) library for customizing the GraphQL execution layer, allowing developers to build, share and compose plugins that enhance the capabilities of your GraphQL server.](https://envelop.dev).
GraphQL Yoga uses [Envelop](https://envelop.dev) under the hood so you can easily extend your server's capabilities with the plugins from [Envelop Ecosystem](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins)

## Example

The following example adds [GraphQL JIT](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/graphql-jit) to our GraphQL Server using [Envelop GraphQL JIT Plugin](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins/use-graphql-jit)

```ts
import { useGraphQLJit } from '@envelop/graphql-jit'
import { createServer } from 'graphql-yoga'

// Provide your schema
const server = createServer({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    type Query {
      greetings: String!
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      greetings: () => 'Hello World!',
    },
  },
  plugins: [useGraphQlJit()],
})

// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```
