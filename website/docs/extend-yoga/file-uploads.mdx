GraphQL Yoga supports [GraphQL Multipart Request Specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) which basically allows you to upload files via HTTP and consume the binary data inside GraphQL Resolvers.

In GraphQL Yoga, you consume uploaded files or blobs as W3 standard [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) or [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) objects.

You can use any kind of client supports GraphQL Upload specification.

const server = new GraphQLServer({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    type Query {
      greetings: String!
    }
    type Mutation {
      uploadFile(file: Upload!): String!
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      greetings: () => 'Hello World!',
    },
    Mutation: {
      readTextFile: async (_, { file }: { file: File }) => {
        const textContent = await file.text()
        return textContent
      },
    },
  },
})
// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
