GraphQL Yoga supports [GraphQL Multipart Request Specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) which basically allows you to upload files via HTTP and consume the binary data inside GraphQL Resolvers.

In GraphQL Yoga, you consume uploaded files or blobs as W3 standard [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) or [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) objects you might be familiar from the browser's API.

[Check out MDN documentation to learn more about `File` objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)

You can use any kind of client supports GraphQL Upload specification.

## Example

You only need to add a scalar type definition for `Upload` in your schema.

`file-upload-example.ts`

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

// Provide your schema
const server = createServer({
  typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
    scalar Upload

    type Query {
      greetings: String!
    }
    type Mutation {
      readTextFile(file: Upload!): String!
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      greetings: () => 'Hello World!',
    },
    Mutation: {
      readTextFile: async (_, { file }: { file: File }) => {
        const textContent = await file.text()
        return textContent
      },
    },
  },
})
// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```

### Test your GraphQL Server with `cURL`

```sh
curl localhost:4000/graphql \
  -F operations='{ "query": "mutation ($file: Upload!) { readTextFile(file: $file) }", "variables": { "file": null } }' \
  -F map='{ "0": ["variables.file"] }' \
  -F 0=@mytext.txt
```
