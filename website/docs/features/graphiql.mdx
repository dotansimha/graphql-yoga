[GraphiQL is an in-browser IDE for writing, validating, and testing GraphQL queries.](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)

You can configure or completely disable GraphiQL with the `graphiql` option.
By default, GraphiQL is only enabled.

## Example

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

// Provide your schema
const server = createServer({
  graphiql: {
    defaultQuery: /* GraphQL */ `
      query {
        hello
      }
    `,
  },
})
// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```

## Disabling GraphiQL

You can disable GraphiQL simply setting the `graphiql` option to `false`.

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

// Provide your schema
const server = createServer({
  graphiql: false,
})
// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```

## Dynamic Options

You can also dynamically set GraphiQL options;

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

// Provide your schema
const server = createServer({
  graphiql: (request: Request) => {
    if (request.headers.get('graphiql-enabled')) {
      return true
    }
    return false
  },
})
// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```

> Be aware that this does not really make your GraphQL server more secure. As long as the introspection and/or the "did you mean x" suggestion feature of GraphQL are enabled.

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
import { useDisableIntrospection } from '@envelop/disable-introspection'

// Provide your schema
const server = createServer({
  graphiql: false,
  plugins: [useDisableIntrospection()],
})
// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```

Disabling the "did you mean x" suggestion feature is not possible at the moment ([see the corresponding graphql-js GitHub issue](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/2247)).

So if your goal is to avoid unknown actors from reverse-engineering your GraphQL schema and executing arbitary operations, it is highly recommended to use persisted operations.
Envelop has the plugin [`@envelop/persisted-operations`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@envelop/persisted-operations) that can be used with GraphQL Yoga.

A more detailed guide and example for adding persisted operations to GraphQL Yoga will follow.

## Offline Usage

By default, GraphiQL code is served from a CDN because if we added GraphiQL code inside Yoga, it would end up with huge bundle size and exceed the payload limit for some environments for example (CF Workers, AWS etc).
If you want to use GraphiQL from a local version, you need to install it manually.

<PackageInstall packages={['@graphql-yoga/render-graphiql']} />

And you need to pass imported `renderGraphiQL` to `createServer` like below;

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'
import { renderGraphiQL } from '@graphql-yoga/render-graphiql'

const yoga = createServer({
  renderGraphiQL,
})

yoga.start()
```
