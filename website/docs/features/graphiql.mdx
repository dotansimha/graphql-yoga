[GraphiQL is an in-browser IDE for writing, validating, and testing GraphQL queries.](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)

You can configure or completely disable GraphiQL with the `graphiql` option.
By default, GraphiQL is only enabled.

## Example

```ts
import { createServer } from '@graphql-yoga/node'

// Provide your schema
const server = createServer({
  graphiql: {
    defaultQuery: /* GraphQL */ `
      query {
        hello
      }
    `,
  },
})
// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```

## Disabling GraphiQL

You can disable GraphiQL simply setting the `graphiql` option to `false`.

```ts
import { createServer } from 'graphql-yoga'

// Provide your schema
const server = createServer({
  graphiql: false,
})
// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```

> Be aware that this does not really make your GraphQL server more secure. As long as the introspection and/or the "did you mean x" suggestion feature of GraphQL are enabled.

```ts
import { createServer } from 'graphql-yoga'

// Provide your schema
const server = createServer({
  graphiql: false,
  introspection: false,
})
// Start the server and explore http://localhost:4000/graphql
server.start()
```

Disabling the "did you mean x" suggestion feature can not be disabled at the moment ([see the corresponding graphql-js GitHub issue](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/2247)).

So if your goal is to avoid unknown actors from reverse-engineering your GraphQL schema and executing arbitary operations, it is highly recommended to use persisted operations.
Envelop has the plugin [`@envelop/persisted-operations`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@envelop/persisted-operations) that can be used with GraphQL Yoga.

A more detailed guide and example for adding persisted operations to GraphQL Yoga will follow.
