Context is an object in GraphQL-js that is provided per execution and it is passed to the resolvers as a third argument. You can learn more about [`Context` in GraphQL Tools docs](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/connectors).

In GraphQL Yoga, the context object is generated per HTTP request, and the content of this object differs based on your setup.

There are 4 steps that GraphQL Yoga follows to generate the final context object;

[Initial Standard Context](#initial-standard-context) -> [Server Context](#server-context) -> [User Context](#user-context) -> [Envelop Plugins](#envelop-plugins)

## Initial Standard Context

By default, GraphQL Yoga provides the following values in the context object independently from your environment and setup;

- **_query_**: The DocumentNode that was parsed from the GraphQL query string.
- **_request_**: [WHATWG `Request` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) that represents the incoming HTTP request in platform independent way.
- **_operationName_**: The operation name selected from the incoming query.
- **_variables_**: The variables that were defined in the query
- **_extensions_**: The extensions that were received from the client

## Server Context

While creating the server instance, GraphQL Yoga accepts an additional object from your base server framework or library that will be merged with the one above.

### For Node.js (`.start()`, Express and Next.js etc)

If you are using GraphQL Yoga as a standalone server with `.start()` method or exposing it as a middleware like we show in our Express and Next.js recipes;

- **_req_**: [Node.js `IncomingMessage` object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage)
- **_res_**: [Node.js `ServerResponse` object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse)

The `req` and `res` objects are merged into the initial context object.

### For advanced Node.js frameworks like Fastify and Koa

You might notice that we are implementing a custom middleware for more complicated server frameworks like Fastify and Koa because they need to handle received responses on their own, so we cannot use a basic Node.js [RequestListener](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) function.
Since they limit our access to the underlying raw `ServerResponse` object, we use `.handleIncomingMessage` method and pass the server context as a second parameter;

For **_Fastify_**, we do the following;

```ts
const response = await graphQLServer.handleIncomingMessage(req, {
  req,
  reply,
})
```

and the context now has `reply` instead of `res`;

- **_reply_**: [Fastify `Reply` object](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reply/)

Also please check our generic definition in `createServer` call to have a type safety;

```ts
const graphQLServer = createServer<{
  req: FastifyRequest
  reply: FastifyReply
}>()
```

### For WHATWG-compliant environments like Cloudflare Workers and Deno;

If you are using Cloudflare Workers with `.start()` method, it will merge [WHATWG `FetchEvent` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent) into the context object.
And that object is almost similar what GraphQL Yoga provides you with `YogaInitialContext`. Other than that, GraphQL Yoga doesn't add anything specific to the context object because it is not needed like in Node.js.

## User Context

Besides the initial context generated based on your setup, GraphQL Yoga also accepts a user context object that will be merged with the initial context.
You can pass a factory function to `context` parameter of `createServer` configuration. That function will receive the combination of the standard initial context and the server's (if available)`, then the return value will be merged into that.

```ts
createContext({
  context: async ({ request }) => {
    const user = await getUserByToken(request.headers.get('authorization'))
    return {
      user,
    }
  },
})
```

In this case your final context object will have an extra `user` property.

## Envelop Plugins

After all the above, Envelop plugins (if you have) receive the context object and can modify it.
See the documentation for [Envelop plugins](/envelop-plugins) for more information.
