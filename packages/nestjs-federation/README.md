## Getting started

### Install

```shell
npm i @nestjs/graphql graphql-yoga graphql @graphql-yoga/nestjs-federation
```

### Create application module

```typescript
import {
  YogaFederationDriver,
  YogaFederationDriverConfig
} from '@graphql-yoga/nestjs-federation'
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql'

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLModule.forRoot<YogaFederationDriverConfig>({
      driver: YogaFederationDriver,
      typePaths: ['**/*.graphql']
    })
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Develop GraphQL

This is just a federation and gateway driver; meaning, everything else should work as [showcased in NestJS federation documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/federation).
