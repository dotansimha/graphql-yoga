## Quick start

### Install

```sh
pnpm add graphql-yoga graphql
```

### Start

Make a schema, create Yoga and start a Node server:

```ts
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { createSchema, createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: createSchema({
    typeDefs: /* GraphQL */ `
      type Query {
        hello: String
      }
    `,
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        hello: () => 'Hello from Yoga!'
      }
    }
  })
})

const server = createServer(yoga)

server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.info('Server is running on http://localhost:4000/graphql')
})
```

## Overview

- **Easiest way to run a GraphQL server:** Sensible defaults & includes everything you need with
  minimal setup (we also export a platform/env-agnostic handler so you can build your own wrappers
  easily).
- **Includes Subscriptions:** Built-in support for GraphQL subscriptions using
  [**S**erver-**S**ent **E**vents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events).
- **Compatible:** Works with all GraphQL clients
  ([Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/), [Relay](https://relay.dev/),
  [Urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/)...) and fits seamless in your GraphQL workflow.
- **WHATWG Fetch API:** the core package depends on
  [WHATWG Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) so it can run and deploy on any environment
  (Serverless, Workers, Deno, Node).
- **Easily Extendable:** New GraphQL-Yoga support all [`envelop`](https://www.envelop.dev) plugins.
