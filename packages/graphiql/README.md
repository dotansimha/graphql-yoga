# Yoga GraphiQL

This the GraphiQL used by GraphQL Yoga.
This package is currently not published to npm and only contains the React component `GraphQLYoga`.

## Development

You can run a local instance on `http://localhost:3000` with the following command".

```ts
yarn workspace @graphiql/yoga start
```

The development server will automatically proxy `http://localhost:4000/graphql`, so make sure you have a Yoga instance running on that port.
