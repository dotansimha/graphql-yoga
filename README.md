```

## Usage

### Quickstart ([Hosted demo](https://demo-graphql-yoga.glitch.me))

```ts
import { GraphQLServer } from 'graphql-yoga'
// ... or using `require()`
// const { GraphQLServer } = require('graphql-yoga')

const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    hello(name: String): String!
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: (_, { name }) => `Hello ${name || 'World'}`,
  },
}

const server = new GraphQLServer({ typeDefs, resolvers })
server.start(() => console.log('Server is running on localhost:4000'))
```

> To get started with `graphql-yoga`, follow the instructions in the READMEs of the [examples](./examples).

### API

#### `GraphQLServer`

##### `constructor(props: Props): GraphQLServer`

The `props` argument accepts the following fields:


| Key                | Type                                                            | Default | Note                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `typeDefs`         | `String` or `Function` or `DocumentNode` or `array` of previous | `null`  | Contains GraphQL type definitions in [SDL](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51) or file path to type definitions (required if `schema` is not provided \*) |
| `resolvers`        | Object                                                          | `null`  | Contains resolvers for the fields specified in `typeDefs` (required if `schema` is not provided \*)                                                                                                |
| `resolverValidationOptions` | Object | `null` | Object which controls the resolver validation behaviour (see ["Generating a schema"](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/generate-schema.html#makeExecutableSchema)) for more information |
| `schema`           | Object                                                          | `null`  | An instance of [`GraphQLSchema`](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema) (required if `typeDefs` and `resolvers` are not provided \*)                                                   |
| `mocks`            | Object or Boolean |  `null`  | Applies [mocks to schema](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools/blob/master/docs/source/mocking.md). Setting this to true will apply a default mock, however you can pass an object to customize the mocks similar to the resolvers map. |
| `context`          | Object or Function                                              | `{}`    | Contains custom data being passed through your resolver chain. This can be passed in as an object, or as a Function with the signature `(req: ContextParameters) => any` \*\*                      |
| `schemaDirectives` | Object                                                          | `null`  | [`Apollo Server schema directives`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/schema-directives.html) that allow for transforming schema types, fields, and arguments                       |
| `middlewares`      | `array` of Middleware                                           | `[]`    | A list of [`GraphQLMiddleware`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-middleware) middleware.                                                                                                       |

> (\*) There are two major ways of providing the [schema](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e) information to the `constructor`:
>
> 1.  Provide `typeDefs` and `resolvers` and omit the `schema`, in this case `graphql-yoga` will construct the `GraphQLSchema` instance using [`makeExecutableSchema`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/generate-schema.html#makeExecutableSchema) from [`graphql-tools`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools).
> 2.  Provide the `schema` directly and omit `typeDefs` and `resolvers`.

> (\*\*) Notice that the `req` argument is an object of the shape `{ request, response, connection }` which either carries a `request: Request` property (when it's a `Query`/`Mutation` resolver), `response: Response` property (when it's a `Query`/`Mutation` resolver), or a `connection: SubscriptionOptions` property (when it's a `Subscription` resolver). [`Request`](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req) is imported from Express.js. [`Response`](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res) is imported from Express.js aswell. `SubscriptionOptions` is from the [`graphql-subscriptions`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions) package. `SubscriptionOptions` are getting the `connectionParams` automatically injected under `SubscriptionOptions.context.[CONNECTION_PARAMETER_NAME]`

Here is example of creating a new server:

```js
const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    hello(name: String): String!
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: (_, { name }) => `Hello ${name || 'World'}`,
  },
}

const server = new GraphQLServer({ typeDefs, resolvers })
```

#### `start(options: Options, callback: ((options: Options) => void) = (() => null)): Promise<void>`

Once your `GraphQLServer` is instantiated, you can call the `start` method on it. It takes two arguments: `options`, the options object defined above, and `callback`, a function that's invoked right before the server is started. As an example, the `callback` can be used to print information that the server has started.

The `options` object has the following fields:

| Key             | Type                                                             | Default         | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `endpoint`      | String                                                           | `'/'`           | Defines the HTTP endpoint of your server                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `subscriptions` | Object or String or `false`                                      | `'/'`           | Defines the subscriptions (websocket) endpoint for your server; accepts an object with [subscription server options](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws#constructoroptions-socketoptions) `path`, `keepAlive`, `onConnect` and `onDisconnect`; setting to `false` disables subscriptions completely |
| `playground`    | String or `false`                                                | `'/'`           | Defines the endpoint where you can invoke the [Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground); setting to `false` disables the playground endpoint                                                                                                                                                             |
| `uploads`       | [UploadOptions](/src/types.ts#L39-L43) or `false` or `undefined` | `null`          | Provides information about upload limits; the object can have any combination of the following three keys: `maxFieldSize`, `maxFileSize`, `maxFiles`; each of these have values of type Number; setting to `false` disables file uploading                                                                                   |

Additionally, the `options` object exposes these `apollo-server` options:

| Key               | Type                 | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

  ),
)
```

#### `PubSub`

See the original documentation in [`graphql-subscriptions`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions).

#### `mocking`

Mocking the schema is straight forward, along wit
```javascript
import { GraphqlServer, MockList } from 'graphql-yoga';

const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    hello(name: String): String!
    listOfStrings: [String]
  }
`

const mocks = {
  Query: () => ({
    hello: () => 'Hello World',
    listOfStrings: () => new MockList([2,6]),
  }),

}

const server = new GraphQLServer({ typeDefs, mocks })
```

### Endpoints

## Examples

There are three examples demonstrating how to quickly get started with `graphql-yoga`:

* [hello-world](./examples/hello-world): Basic setup for building a schema and allowing for a `hello` query.
* [subscriptions](./examples/subscriptions): Basic setup for using subscriptions with a counter that increments every 2 seconds and triggers a subscription.
* [fullstack](./examples/fullstack): Fullstack example based on [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) demonstrating how to query data from `graphql-yoga` with [Apollo Client 2.0](https://www.apollographql.com/client/).

## Workflow

Once your `graphql-yoga` server is running, you can use [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground) out of the box – typically running on `localhost:4000`. (Read [here](https://blog.graph.cool/introducing-graphql-playground-f1e0a018f05d) for more information.)

## FAQ

### How does `graphql-yoga` compare to `apollo-server` and other tools?

As mentioned above, `graphql-yoga` is built on top of a variety of other packages, such as `graphql.js`, `express` and `apollo-server`. Each of these provides a certain piece of functionality required for building a GraphQL server.

Using these packages individually incurs overhead in the setup process and requires you to write a lot of boilerplate. `graphql-yoga` abstracts away the initial complexity and required boilerplate and lets you get started quickly with a set of sensible defaults for your server configuration.

`graphql-yoga` is like [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for building GraphQL servers.

### Can't I just setup my own GraphQL server using `express` and `graphql.js`?

`graphql-yoga` is all about convenience and a great "Getting Started" experience by abstracting away the complexity that comes when you're building your own GraphQL server from scratch. It's a pragmatic approach to bootstrap a GraphQL server, much like how [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) removes friction when first starting out with React.

Whenever the defaults of `graphql-yoga` are too tight a corset for you, you can simply _eject_ from it and use the tooling it's built upon - there's no lock-in or any other kind of magic going on preventing you from doing this.

### How to eject from the standard `express` setup?

The core value of `graphql-yoga` is that you don't have to write the boilerplate required to configure your [express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/) application. However, once you need to add more customized behaviour to your server, the default configuration provided by `graphql-yoga` might not suit your use case any more. For example, it might be the case that you want to add more custom _middleware_ to your server, like for logging or error reporting.

For these cases, `GraphQLServer` exposes the `express.Application` directly via its [`express`](./src/index.ts#L17) property:

```js
server.express.use(myMiddleware())
```

Middlewares can also be added specifically to the GraphQL endpoint route, by using:

```js
server.express.post(server.options.endpoint, myMiddleware())
```

Any middlewares you add to that route, will be added right before the `apollo-server-express` middleware.
